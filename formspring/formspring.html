                                    Yes, I&#39;m working on it now, among other things. It&#39;s nice to hear you like the idea.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The flash stuff will be handled in a way that graphic novels have been
                                    effectively conveying dramatic action for a long time. Through
                                    sequential art.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A number of people seem to have trouble with the concept of a book
                                    adaptation, almost to the point where the idea of the object existing
                                    somewhere in reality offends them. It seems some would prefer it not
                                    exist at all, even if it means denying it from those who really want a
                                    book adaptation despite the obvious cross-media challenges. If we were
                                    all supremely literal people by equal measure, we would all demand a DVD
                                    treatment or something similar, with all the music and animation intact
                                    as it is on the web. However, some people like books. They like a
                                    physical, tactile object that you can take off a shelf, flip through and
                                    read, without turning something on or glaring at a screen for hours.
                                    This is why books still exist, and why we haven&#39;t decided to burn down
                                    our libraries quite yet.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Taking such strong issue with adaptation from one form of media to
                                    another is puzzling to me. It happens all the time. Books are adapted to
                                    movies, and back. Musicals become films, films become games, games
                                    become comics. Stories have many ways they can be told. If someone were
                                    going to make a graphic novel out of a movie, imagine how absurd it
                                    would be to ask the artist, &quot;Oh yeah? How are you going to handle all
                                    the moving around bits? Like, all that motion that happens in movies?
                                    Oh, what about the MUSIC??&quot; The objection is actually profoundly
                                    idiotic, but we don&#39;t actually hear people raise such qualms with these
                                    sorts of adaptations, probably because they are known quantities. We
                                    know what a book-to-film adaptation is like. It&#39;s a Thing. Bringing
                                    Homestuck into static media is not a Thing, because I essentially
                                    invented the original format. This probably messes with people&#39;s heads
                                    on the issue somewhat. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I guess part of it is that craving absolute purity and fidelity from an
                                    adaptation is a hallmark of the zealously devoted. That&#39;s fine, but
                                    isn&#39;t really a point of view I cotton to. It&#39;s very rigid, very linear,
                                    and those demands are ironically antithetical to the spirit behind HS&#39;s
                                    creation, and all those crazy things that allegedly won&#39;t cross over to
                                    print. So you say HS &quot;absolutely cannot exist in a book?&quot; If I had much
                                    concern for what a story absolutely could or couldn&#39;t be, I wouldn&#39;t
                                    have even made it in the first place. Imagine again a movie with all its
                                    motion and sound becoming a graphic novel, and how reasonable this
                                    endeavor is. What if the hyper-zealous nerd has concerns that the novel
                                    won&#39;t be able to capture all of this FEELING and EMOTION from the scenes
                                    that the pacing and sound evoked through perfect, literal duplication
                                    in print? Well, it won&#39;t. It&#39;s not supposed to, and it&#39;s a completely
                                    unreasonable expectation to have for the adaptation. It will be a
                                    different angle on the work, and that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s great, in fact. It
                                    should be what you want from an adaptation. If you want to re-experience
                                    exactly what you felt in its original form, then you may go enjoy it in
                                    its original form again. That&#39;s why it&#39;s there.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The funny thing is, all the types of adaptations I mentioned, like
                                    book-to-film, are very major departures in format. A Homestuck book
                                    actually comes quite close to representing the original work by
                                    comparison, because after all, HS is at least 95% mostly-static panels,
                                    with text underneath. Anyone who says that&#39;s outrageously unfit for
                                    print is being quite extreme. As a whole, the thing is basically a great
                                    big comic. A comic with a few perks the web affords.

                                    This suggestion has come up a million times, even before I did
                                    the PS books and people were wondering how those were going to work with
                                    all the animation, or if they even COULD work. (Fast forward to now,
                                    those books went off without a hitch and they&#39;re totally sweet!)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Embedding a flipbook in an HS book couldn&#39;t be anything more than a
                                    novelty. Some little thing you stick in the corner, turn the whole book
                                    to the side, and flip through the pages. It would allow for very little
                                    meaningful animation to be presented.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Basically, if this suggestion is serious, my response is: man, that is
                                    sooo literal. It&#39;s not a reasonable way to show animation in a book that
                                    also tells a mostly unanimated story, and it doesn&#39;t solve a problem
                                    which isn&#39;t even really a problem.

                                    rebellion caused the Empress to banish adults from the home world to
                                    fight the wars in space. This doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s when they invented

                                    Sufferer&#39;s time apparently. But after Alternia turned &quot;kids only&quot; there
                                    was much more emphasis on interstellar conquest, to keep all the adults
                                    too busy to organize any more rebellions.

                                    Terezi mentioned Troll Jegus in a joking exchange with John a
                                    while ago. Whether the Sufferer&#39;s name is actually Jegus, and whether or
                                    not she actually knew anything about this story when she said that, is
                                    left to your speculation.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This ancestor interlude is a little religious tale. Over the course of
                                    the story sometimes we wander into these silly mini-genres, like
                                    &quot;horrorstuck&quot;, or erotic historical fiction through Mindfang&#39;s journal
                                    entries. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Jesus parallel is pretty blatant, down to the use of the torture
                                    device as the symbol for the religious movement (cross, irons). I
                                    personally think the explanation of the relevance of Karkat&#39;s sign is
                                    one of the more interesting aspects about it, just from the perspective
                                    of taking existing symbols and adapting them to an evolving mythological
                                    framework. Segments like this aren&#39;t really just about &quot;Gee, the
                                    ancestors sure are cool, let&#39;s hear more about them.&quot; (Though there&#39;s no
                                    question there&#39;s a certain amount of fan service in play when I do
                                    stuff like this.) We learn more about the story and characters and
                                    answer questions beyond the limited scope of their biographies, like why
                                    Karkat had a sign at all if he had no caste.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We learn more about the troll race, as a once peaceful species and such
                                    before kid-ancestors as players scratched their session, though the
                                    short term relevance of this is mainly as a preamble to Scratch&#39;s
                                    religious story. Establishing an Eden-like paradise from which there is
                                    some departure through sin is sort of the boilerplate basis for
                                    religious lore. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Scratch is a devil figure about as blatant as the Sufferer is a Christ
                                    figure. The failed players from peaceful Alternia made a classic &quot;deal
                                    with the devil&quot; move by causing the scratch after being given a choice
                                    by the mother of all monsters. (Echidna. Hey, she&#39;s a big snake!) By
                                    doing so they brought Scratch into their universe, and therefore all the
                                    things you&#39;d expect that comes with summoning the devil. This resulted
                                    not only turning Alternia into a planet full of violent murderers, but
                                    it only technically granted them what they wanted with a huge caveat, as
                                    is the case with such ill-advised bargains. The players were strong
                                    enough to win, but made a terminal universe, were barred from entry,
                                    hunted by a demon, and then started killing each other. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    &quot;Old Scratch&quot; is actually an old timey nickname for the devil. It&#39;s used
                                    in some Twain books. The manipulative devil figure pulling the strings
                                    was always the basis for his character, and this was probably pretty
                                    obvious right away. He&#39;s part devil/puppet/cueball, with a dash of the
                                    old gambler/gunslinger Doc Holliday in his profile. Doc Holliday is
                                    actually my ancestor. He is related to me on my mother&#39;s side, who&#39;s
                                    last name is also Holliday.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hopefully I won&#39;t die at age 36 of tuberculosis though. If there&#39;s
                                    anything to the karmic fortune-swapping of the trolls and their
                                    ancestors, ideally tuberculosis will die of me.

                                    The pantskat gag has been reiterated a few times now. The first
                                    time (I think was the fedorafreak log?) was just a dumb little shoutout.
                                    Subsequent times was essentially for the benefit of archive readers who
                                    wouldn&#39;t understand or even notice the reference. Repetition ossifies
                                    it as a running gag, so instead of it going over their heads the first
                                    time, a few gags later they start to ask, hey what&#39;s with these
                                    references to guys wearing tall pants?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It is to their benefit, by which I mean, does not improve their understanding of the
                                    gag by any measure whatsoever.

                                    He amplified John&#39;s fears in his dream to take the form of a voodoo doll
                                    that looked somewhat like Jack and was dressed like a clown.<br>

                                    This made him subconsciously scribble clowns all over his wall, which
                                    made his dad think he was into clowns. So his dad began collecting
                                    harlequins believing he was sharing in John&#39;s interests.<br>

                                    He then got him the big harlequin doll for his birthday. The doll was maimed, lost
                                    an arm and an eye, and was prototyped.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The clown prototyping caused Jack to become especially angry at the
                                    queen over the new dress code. All of this lead to big problems.

                                <div class="cright"></div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="response-container">
                                <p>
                                    It&#39;s not clear that he is getting in touch with his in-game
                                    powers, like John did with the windy thing, or whether withdrawing from
                                    his sopor slime haze is bringing out psychic powers he would have had
                                    anyway.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The latter would make sense for his bloodline though. If this were a
                                    common ability among subjugglators, it would help explain why they&#39;re
                                    able to hold power over all lower classes.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It&#39;s implied that they&#39;re very strong and dangerous, in addition to
                                    being insane and unpredictable. But this by itself doesn&#39;t necessarily
                                    explain why they&#39;d be able to keep power over such a huge population of
                                    similarly dangerous trolls, which also have many deadly powers.
                                    Especially since, also implied, the higher the blood, the longer they
                                    live. This means lower classes must be much more copious than higher
                                    classes. The lowbloods die off much more quickly, and so must be spawned
                                    in greater numbers. Those with high longevity can&#39;t afford to be
                                    spawned in such numbers, or the population would be out of control. At
                                    the top of the hierarchy is the Empress, who lives for thousands of
                                    years. There is only one of her class, discounting her successor.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For the subjugglators in their small numbers to keep such a large
                                    population under their control, it would be very useful to have the
                                    ability to psychically amplify fears through dreams. They may have
                                    directed their chucklevoodoos on every susceptible mind in the
                                    population. Each lowblood may have a little highblood voodoo doll
                                    lurking in their subconscious, making them too terrified to organize any
                                    sort of rebellion. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Additional notes:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now knowing he had this ability, we can wonder whether he used it during
                                    his rampage, in addition to using it on John/Dave. Did he use the
                                    ability to befuddle Terezi into pinning the crime on Vriska in spite of
                                    laughably overwhelming evidence to the contrary? Turning Terezi against
                                    Vriska was likely the only way he could kill Vriska, due to her cerebral
                                    &quot;luck neutralizing&quot; ability. Did he exaggerate Karkat&#39;s fears to
                                    destabilize the team? What about Equius? Maybe he exaggerated his fear
                                    of failing to show a superior deference, to the point of incapacitation.

                                    Scratch keeps Aradia (???) locked up in a room with a 5th wall.
                                    She turned it on and tried to break it, presumably to attempt to escape.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Through the 5th wall, you can see me positioning two 4th walls facing
                                    each other, exactly one yard apart. English&#39;s coat is still draped over
                                    one. I put that there a while ago to obscure Jade&#39;s view of me.
                                    Remember?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A 4th wall is an object that when broken or compromised, allows an
                                    author to interact directly with the audience or characters in the
                                    story.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A 5th wall is a partition separating two omniscient narrators, which when broken,
                                    allows them to mess with each other.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It is all so, so simple.

                                    I will happen to be in the area over the weekend for unrelated
                                    reasons, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to pony up the 80 bucks or whatever
                                    to get a load of the animes. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What I might do is briefly lurk outside the convention, and sneak up
                                    behind HS cosplayers while they take photos of each other, and then
                                    quickly vanish into the scenery. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m suddenly not sure which idea is more amusing. Actually doing that,
                                    or the fact that by saying so here, I have guaranteed that all HS
                                    cosplayers will be nervously looking over their shoulders all weekend.

                                    The page rate is deceptively slow when you zoom in on a select
                                    few days. There was a 6 day pause, then 13 pages went up. So that&#39;s
                                    about 2 pages per day, which is &quot;slow&quot;, right? But then you wait a few
                                    more days, and 23 pages have stacked up, and suddenly that rate jumps to
                                    4 pages per day, which is close to the site average. And if you examine
                                    the period between now and 10 days ago, the rate is almost 8 pages per
                                    day, which is way above average. It&#39;s better to think of the output in
                                    longer term averages. This is harder for those who demand regularity and
                                    predictability, which is something you get from some comics which
                                    update once every weekday, or m/w/f, without fail as part of their
                                    product delivery pledge. In these cases, the regularity of the output
                                    strikes me as being almost as important, and sometimes more important,
                                    than the quality of the content itself. This is because people are
                                    creatures of habit, and have a strong craving for reliability. Many will
                                    quite happily absorb work they consider to be fairly mediocre as long
                                    as it is cranked out like clockwork. The sunday funnies is probably a
                                    good long term example of this. Millions of people gobbled up decades of
                                    Marmaduke without ever laughing once, but editors wouldn&#39;t dare fuck
                                    with Marmaduke because people needed that shit with their coffee for
                                    some reason. You could put a gun to their head and they couldn&#39;t tell
                                    you why. There is comfort in even bland routine. If you mess with
                                    people&#39;s comfort and destabilize certain regularities in their universe,
                                    they become agitated, even angry. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now, if people actually have any sort of passion for the entertainment
                                    comprising their routine, then they become even more agitated if the
                                    output is disturbed. Passionate interest severely exacerbates the
                                    situation, and can make a creator envy someone like Marmaduke Guy who
                                    spent his career crouching safely in mediocrity, grinding out awful dog
                                    comics everyone became totally comfortable with disliking. (I bet he
                                    never got an angry letter from an anime fan.) But if you mess with the
                                    schedule of material that people zealously crave, they are not merely
                                    irked, but can receive it as a personal affront from the author. This is
                                    true in varying degrees for probably most enthusiastic readers, but is
                                    more pronounced by the degree to which a person is mentally ill. <br>

                                    There are some particularly unpleasant entities out there who pose
                                    questions similar to yours, but much less politely. These are seemingly
                                    self appointed watchdogs for my page rate, and I think I&#39;m safe in
                                    assuming most are severely under-medicated teens with a bigtime beef
                                    about You Fucking Name It. As torrid a pace as Homestuck has been
                                    unloaded on the public, I think it must have been pretty easy for some
                                    spoiled children to factor that rate of output into the entitlement
                                    complex which presides over their central nervous systems. Deviation
                                    from that production schedule in the minds of the entitled means nothing
                                    other than offense committed by the author, or more generously, just a
                                    staggering display of laziness. Never mind that the alleged deviation
                                    may not even QUITE exist (see numbers in first paragraph). But if it
                                    did, I wonder whose rate of production they would compare it to, aside
                                    from some foggy recollection of my own? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For such people, what would probably be useful would be a dose of
                                    perspective. Not that they&#39;re likely to read this, but let&#39;s consider
                                    the following data anyway, kindly provided by tvtropes.com.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    MSPA is the longest web comic on record, in terms of update quantity. It
                                    accumulated most of this content in about 3 years. Now consider that
                                    the second comic on the list is approximately THE OLDEST WEB COMIC IN
                                    EXISTENCE. It dates back to 1995, which for all intents and purposes was
                                    the year the internet was born. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are of course some mitigating factors. Most MSPA updates are a
                                    single panel, with some accompanying text. But there are some
                                    counter-caveats which make this a bit more difficult to process. There
                                    are several hours of animated Flash footage mixed in with the updates.
                                    There are several more hours of interactive gameplay. Each Flash
                                    instance occupies a single update. Many updates are accompanied by
                                    several pages of dialogue. Some of these individual conversations would
                                    take up 50 pages worth of speech bubbles in a graphic novel. The total
                                    word count for MSPA likely exceeds most of the comics on that list, or
                                    possibly all of them. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising. Homestuck alone is over
                                    300K words. Again, this effort was compressed into the last 3 years,
                                    while most of the other comics date back to the 90&#39;s.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    What does this mean? Here is what it means.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let&#39;s imagine MSPA was distributed more like a &quot;normal comic&quot;. Where,
                                    even with a healthy update schedule of 7 days a week, you still only get
                                    one new thing to click on. One update per day. It could be a simple
                                    panel with a silly gag and no text. Could be a panel with 10 pages of
                                    dialogue beneath it. Or it could be a 3 minute flash animation. All are
                                    things that appear in the archive in good supply. Distributing one such
                                    thing per day, as the designated &quot;product&quot;, would be a completely
                                    reasonable policy. If that were the established pattern from the start,
                                    nobody would think it was remotely inappropriate, and nobody would ask
                                    for more, in the same way that nobody ever demands that Penny Arcade
                                    update 7 days a week instead of 3.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If that were the case, MSPA would now have 16 years worth of content. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So what does THIS mean??<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It means, given that I started 3 years ago, I could take a 13 year break
                                    starting now, and at the end of that break, MSPA&#39;s lifetime rate of
                                    production would still manage to make the lifetime rate of most other
                                    comics seem underwhelming. This is literally, actually true, even though
                                    it sounds like a joke. There is statistical evidence to support this,
                                    using the only data that matters, which is the existing work of peers in
                                    the same field.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So if some twerp who&#39;s never put a stretch of hard work into anything
                                    aside from grinding for levels in WoW all weekend decides to get on my

                                    I&#39;m not really thinking about which style is better. Mainly what
                                    matters here is the idea doesn&#39;t work unless I post a large amount of
                                    content at once. So that&#39;s what I do.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m sure there are differences in the reading experience. Some may find
                                    it more gratifying to read a lot at once. It certainly consolidates
                                    impact, which is something that is often lost through the slow, steady
                                    serial drip. But they may also find it frustrating to wait longer for
                                    the pages to stack up. It may provoke the feeling that output is slowing
                                    down, or grinding to a halt.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is not actually true though. After the 6 day pause, 41 pages were
                                    posted. That&#39;s about 7 pages per day, which is higher than the site&#39;s
                                    lifetime average of 5 pages per day. It&#39;s actually a hot streak!

                                    Or he will do something cowardly at the last minute to save himself, in the nick of

                                    In the same way that Equius exemplified the culture surrounding the admiration of

                                    For those that don&#39;t know, Rose&#39;s house as well as a few other locations have
                                    concrete GPS coordinates in the real world.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Her house is located here, over a real waterfall called Rainbow Falls in the

                                    Kind of an odd place for a house. But then, it&#39;s an unusual house.
                                    Sticking a secret lab in some remote place in a huge nature preserve
                                    might make some sense.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Jade&#39;s location is even more remote.<br>

                                    John&#39;s house is an actual house. It was for sale at one point. Don&#39;t know if it
                                    still is. It&#39;s just below Pipe Lake.<br>

                                    Nah, I was mostly useless on the road. I eked out those two pages preceding this
                                    while away, and that&#39;s it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The couple days after returning were useless too. Took the last few days to make
                                    these. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I guess the bottom line is 30 panels still take a pretty good while to make??<br>

                                    The same was true for all those header images. If you look at the
                                    archive for the past month or so, it doesn&#39;t look like a hot and heavy
                                    update pace. But take into consideration that there are now 80 separate

                                    Not Bard Quest necessarily, just taking advantage of the fact
                                    that I built the site from the beginning to allow branching paths, even
                                    if they all wind up back at the same place. Every other story does this.
                                    BQ obviously, Jailbreak has one fork that converges again, and Problem
                                    sleuth uses a couple really quick offshoots to handle deaths and other
                                    fuck-ups.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Aside from that, one of the main points of the Scratch segment was not
                                    only to slip into a different gear with respect to story pacing, but to
                                    introduce a vehicle to explore new methods for engaging with events in a
                                    story which has accrued a vast amount of detail and complexity. The
                                    consequence has been a little more detachment from the events directly
                                    as we experience some mediation between us and the characters through
                                    this host. But what comes with that bit of extra distance from the
                                    story, and bringing to fore its features as a work of metafiction, are
                                    these devices for accessing this complex story which wouldn&#39;t make sense
                                    to introduce without letting this segment build some momentum.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Telling the story in parallel through the header images was an example
                                    of that potential, and tying together the themes in the header with the
                                    main content was one of the interesting challenges. And of course the
                                    narrator himself is a character with a role in the story, so as he tells
                                    the story he is advancing his own role in it as well. A lot more is
                                    being advanced at the same time, in a way that I think is fun and in the
                                    spirit of everything on the site. The scrapbook thing is another
                                    example, a way of utilizing some of these silly meta-story devices which
                                    at first appear to be mocking the format itself, but become another
                                    useful gateway into a bunch of different threads of the story at once.
                                    Of course you read those threads one at a time, but the feeling is that
                                    they&#39;re being accessed in parallel. Using parallel story telling devices
                                    seemed like an interesting way to address what has become a formidable
                                    number of threads to keep track of, and also a fun way to give some
                                    forgotten details a little more attention which would seem like a pretty
                                    frivolous diversion otherwise (like Nepeta talking to Jaspers), while
                                    still finding a way to give them a little relevance to the current
                                    storylines. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In a way the Scratch segment has been like busting open a pinata of
                                    different storytelling devices and seeing what&#39;s there to work with. And
                                    he sort of did that literally when he broke the scrapbook over Slick&#39;s
                                    head, releasing all the clippings from the story, both old and new.
                                    Having them strewn about the place is another semi-mocking
                                    acknowledgement of the nature of the story, a thing which has dissolved
                                    into absolute nonlinearity, where looking into a panel at any point in
                                    time, past present or future, reality memory dream or afterlife, is
                                    something which can advance the plot. Because it advances not just
                                    through unfolding action, but by what previously concealed information
                                    is exposed, and how it&#39;s presented. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was actually one of the reasons for devising the dream bubble
                                    system. It serves a purpose in the plot, yes, but it also has flexible
                                    narrative utility. The dream bubbles allow moments of the past to be
                                    explored, or moments of an alternate timeline, through memories of
                                    characters in such a way that it doesn&#39;t have to be a strict flashback,
                                    can be invested with more immediate relevance to what&#39;s going on, and
                                    allows a way for characters to talk about it. (Remember, rules for when
                                    dialogue is allowed are pretty strict! Dream bubbles amended the rules
                                    such that characters can converse directly when dreaming or dead. This
                                    is because the segments begin as memories consisting of online
                                    conversations, and continue from there.) It was a more effective way to
                                    convey Cal&#39;s final journey and Scratch&#39;s origin, for instance. And it
                                    again becomes a useful tool when examining a clipping on the floor of an
                                    obscure event in the past. We enter the panel somewhat like the
                                    characters do, seeing it as a memory of something that&#39;s already
                                    happened, but the scene evolves as the characters remember, and soon
                                    through their interaction it catches up with the current state of the
                                    story and contributes to it. Other clippings are played a little more
                                    straight, like we are briefly entering a window to another parallel
                                    event, then moving on. Either way, going into his clippings momentarily
                                    reconnects us directly with the story rather than experiencing it
                                    through his mediation. But then, the mediation allowed us to do this in
                                    the first place. There&#39;ll probably be a few more of these scrapbook
                                    gateways before we&#39;re done with them.

                                    Wait, it&#39;s this question again! The exact same question, what are the odds. It&#39;s
                                    like the question&#39;s ghost or something.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I agree that dropping from 16 to 8 characters leaves the story direly
                                    under-staffed. I mean when it was down to 14 that was already pretty
                                    sketchy territory. People were asking &quot;can hussie REALLY finish a story
                                    with only 14 main characters? i know he&#39;s good, but is that even
                                    POSSIBLE?&quot; 8 is practically a skeleton crew!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But don&#39;t worry, help is on the way. Soon I will launch the lengthy
                                    squiddle intermission, documenting the tale of the 48 heroic squiddles
                                    who played in the session which created the troll universe. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    At first, people will bemoan this drastic departure from the &quot;real
                                    story&quot; and wonder when we can get back to Homestuck proper. But over
                                    time, you will grow to love each squiddle dearly. Each will be more
                                    exquisitely characterized than the last, and it is only then, when you
                                    have welcomed them into your hearts, will the ruthless culling begin. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Then we&#39;ll get back to the trolls and you&#39;ll be like fuck these guys.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I&#39;m not hesitant about following through with long term plans I made.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Most of these characters didn&#39;t exist a year ago. Vriska was introduced
                                    in July last year. I opened these arcs understanding most of them would
                                    likely be closed, and every gesture has paved the way for what you see
                                    now. Act five has been a great swelling of cast complexity followed by a
                                    great contraction. I knew it was going to have this overall structure. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Another approach would have been to treat this cast like that of a
                                    syndicated cartoon, with amusing but basically static lives. Antics
                                    happen, hijinks are afoot, everyone is pals and things are ok forever.
                                    Tune in next week! I don&#39;t deny there&#39;s entertainment value in that,
                                    with the content leaning on characters and relationships above anything
                                    else. This is actually the reality of this work echoed by the collective
                                    consciousness of fan artists, who cast all these characters in a
                                    perma-living state playing out amusing scenarios with each other. It&#39;s
                                    fun. Doesn&#39;t serve the bigger story much! Not one with a complex
                                    architecture headed in a very specific direction, but fun nonetheless.
                                    It would be prioritizing character far beyond the overarching story. I&#39;m
                                    not doing that. Certainly not with characters always designed to play a
                                    transient role.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The bottom line is, I had plans, and I stuck to them. I wouldn&#39;t change
                                    them midstream because I got the sense that some people would rather
                                    Homestuck be &quot;Trolls! The Sitcom.&quot;

                                    why I presented it through the mechanism of the scattered photo album
                                    which mocks the entire visual callback phenomenon which everyone has
                                    come to anticipate now. <br>

                                    I try to anticipate if certain outcomes are guessable. If it is, I don&#39;t
                                    necessarily dismiss the idea, but I do try to do something unexpected
                                    with it, if not in substance, at least delivery.

                                    The story provides no conclusive answer to this, and I
                                    personally cannot provide the scoop either. Not that I am withholding it
                                    to be coy, but to take my word for it one way or another would be
                                    missing the point. The destruction of the clock is another element among
                                    many for you to weigh when considering these events.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    First, there&#39;s the consideration of whether her death was just, heroic,
                                    or neither. The clock appeared to be leaning toward &quot;just&quot;, when it was
                                    interrupted by the crowbar. Maybe it would have landed there. Or if
                                    given the chance, maybe it would have swung back and settled somewhere
                                    else. We don&#39;t have a definitive ruling. All we know for sure is she&#39;s
                                    dead.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So we can conclude that either: <br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) The clock itself has no bearing on her life directly, much as clocks
                                    merely measure time without influencing it. Which would mean if given
                                    the chance it definitely would have landed on either just or heroic, but
                                    not in the middle. The proof is her death.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    or <br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) The result of the clock does have direct bearing on her life, and by
                                    knocking the clock over so that it stuck on &quot;just&quot;, Slick inadvertently
                                    killed her for good, regardless of where it may have landed. But to be
                                    fair, if he knew it was going to kill her, he might be hitting it
                                    harder. You could consider it delayed revenge for his exile, which
                                    Vriska and Snowman coordinated. It&#39;s safe to assume Slick would have
                                    found her death to be quite just, and may have been weighing in on the
                                    matter through circumstantial serendipity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If 2) is true, there is another wrinkle to consider. Recall that the
                                    crowbar he is using (from the intermission) has the property of being
                                    able to nullify the effect of whatever &quot;enchanted&quot; object it destroys.
                                    If the clock&#39;s power is to decide whether she resurrects, then by
                                    destroying it, he eliminates that power. Since there&#39;s no longer a force
                                    enabling her to resurrect, she remains dead. This is another way to
                                    look at it, but again, only if the clock itself has that power over her
                                    life.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If not, then the destruction of the clock becomes more a violent gesture
                                    of punctuation to accompany this &quot;divine ruling&quot;, like nails being
                                    driven into a coffin. Or, like a tolling bell. It&#39;s jarring, sudden, and
                                    carries finality.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you are convinced her actions are what decided her death, and not the
                                    destruction of the clock, then you are left to consider what outcome is
                                    most suitable, without having an absolute ruling on it. The clock did
                                    appear to lean &quot;just&quot; an instant before, and there are plenty of ways to
                                    argue in favor of a just death. There are many mitigating factors as
                                    well to supply a counter argument. It would not be that interesting if
                                    it were absolutely unambiguous, where everyone could all easily agree
                                    that her death was just. Or if everyone agreed there was no justice in
                                    it at all. There are enough factors in play where you have reason to
                                    think about it a bit, and such that it leaves plenty to discuss. You may
                                    consider the evidence and draw a conclusion. You may even feel very
                                    strongly about your conclusion! But for either the story, or me, to
                                    provide a categorically &quot;right answer&quot;, immediately following the
                                    establishment of all the things that made it interesting to consider,
                                    shortchanges all that, I believe. For the clock to settle
                                    unceremoniously on &quot;just&quot; I feel would come across as a nonconstructive,
                                    compact ethical lecture, quickly nullifying all there was to evaluate
                                    and talk about.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Was this comeuppance for all her past killing? For killing friends like
                                    Aradia and Tavros? Was there mitigation in her upbringing? In her
                                    remorse, and desire to change? Was it justice for insisting on playing a
                                    role in the creation of Jack so that she could beat him, to serve her
                                    ego? What of the ignored warning from Terezi? Flying off in spite of it,
                                    endangering them all, again in service of ego? What of the doomed
                                    timeline she creates by doing this? Is there justice alone in killing
                                    her to prevent not only the death of all her friends, but an offshoot
                                    reality that can only fail? Is human morality in play here? Troll
                                    morality?? Or is it a higher agency, like that permeating Skaia? In a
                                    framework of Skaian morality, is there justice in sacrificing one life
                                    to help ensure the creation of an entire universe? This paragraph has
                                    been a thumbnail sketch of all the discussion which has already taken
                                    place across the internet, minus all the notes ranging from fan fervor
                                    to outright dementia. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Of all the arguments to make, it&#39;s difficult to come up with a solid
                                    rationale for a heroic result. Most people debating it would choose
                                    between &quot;just&quot; or &quot;not just&quot;, i.e. die or live. Note that this means
                                    those who believe her death was not just are in fact arguing that the
                                    destruction of the clock is actually what killed her!!! There is nothing
                                    in the story which rules this out.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Regardless, the result is the same. She&#39;s dead. Out of the story for
                                    good? Who knows. For now it&#39;s the culmination of a wide arc importing
                                    elements from classic tragedy. Blind seers, wanton hubris, unheeded
                                    warnings, regret and death. But with some MSPA twists. Systematized
                                    mortality conditions, doomed timeline offshoots, way too much dramatic
                                    irony, and Nic Cage.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    She was always a polarizing character. Shouldn&#39;t be too surprising she&#39;s
                                    more polarizing than ever in death. It&#39;s almost as if that polarity was
                                    given concrete expression through the rules dictating whether she lived
                                    or died.<br>

                                    Since 4/13, I never imagined there would be a very significant
                                    6/12 &quot;celebratory update&quot;. It would require planning the right moment in
                                    the story for it to coincide exactly with that date, while allotting
                                    well beforehand the time to implement it when it comes, with no
                                    unforeseen delays at all. So I ruled it out well in advance to avoid the
                                    inevitable unpleasant conflict. The anticipation of such an update was a
                                    product of your inflated sense of expectation, and standards which you
                                    reserve for no comic artist other than me.<br>

                                    This will realistically never come up again, so here is how they work.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Matchsticks (11) travels through time using fire at any point in time as
                                    a gateway. He then likes to put out the fire when he arrives, so that
                                    more copies of him from other points in time don&#39;t show up and make
                                    things complicated. Unless he wants to exploit that for battle purposes,
                                    which he clearly didn&#39;t. Scratch keeps a fire alarm in his apartment to
                                    summon him, in case it catches fire, which it clearly did.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Quarters (14) has a collection of coins like the one Clover flipped.
                                    Each has numbers on either side, corresponding to a member of the Felt,
                                    most separated by 10, with a few exceptions. i.e.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    1, 11<br>
                                    2, 12<br>
                                    3, 13<br>
                                    4, 14<br>
                                    5, 15<br>
                                    6, 9<br>
                                    7, 10<br>
                                    8, 8<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When you flip the coin, it summons the member whose number is face up,
                                    from some place in space and time. If the opposite member is present
                                    during the flip, he trades places with that member, which is why Clover
                                    swapped for Quarters when he flipped 14.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you flip your own coin, and the result is your own number, you die.
                                    As such, Quarters entrusts his own coin with Clover, who is so lucky, he
                                    will never flip a 4. He uses it to summon Quarters when things get too
                                    hot to handle. It&#39;s not advisable to let Snowman flip her own coin.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The coins link pairs of Felt members. Some are relevant pairings, others
                                    don&#39;t make much sense. Die and Stitch have a similar power, with their
                                    destructive/healing voodoo doll and effigies. Doze and Eggs make a pair
                                    of morons with a funny duo name (dozen eggs!) Itchy runs around so fast
                                    he probably starts fires sometimes, while Matchsticks puts them out.

                                    Guys it is the FORMSPRING QUESTION OF THE DAY! Maybe I will only
                                    answer these vapid questions for a while, leaving you all to wonder how
                                    many penises trolls have. *<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m a virgo, which is why when I was dressed as a troll in the story, I
                                    had a virgo shirt on. As a cool bonus, that symbol looks a little like
                                    it says &quot;Me&quot;, which is really quite ironic, since I myself happen to be
                                    me.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Two answer the second part of the question, yes it is very
                                    representative of who I am, because as I have mentioned before, I am a
                                    just this HUGE lesbian. Big time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I was wearing a Karkat shirt today though, because I&#39;ve got all these HS
                                    shirts lying around that I wear sometimes. A cashier saw it and said,
                                    &quot;Hey I&#39;m a cancer too!&quot; And I didn&#39;t know what to say, so I said, &quot;Oh!
                                    ........................................... Haha! Yeah.&quot; And completed
                                    the transaction.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m starting to be a little more reluctant to wear the HS shirts though,
                                    because they&#39;re starting to get me recognized in public more
                                    frequently. Not just as an HS reader, but as actually me, which will
                                    never not be a vaguely disorienting, Truman Showesque experience.<br>

                                    What took place over those pages is almost a direct transcription of
                                    what would have happened in the flash. The events were conveyed visually
                                    and verbally to suit the Scratch narration, instead of shown through
                                    high-intensity animated visuals alone. The Scratch segment was not
                                    introduced as a substitute for the animation. An &quot;abridged&quot; stretch like
                                    this was going to come anyway as a device for setting a few things up
                                    before starting on the EOA animation. Axing the Rose v. Jack / Vriska v.
                                    Jack animation (aka Heroes of Light: Strife) just meant moving Scratch
                                    the segment up sooner, to use as a vehicle for delivering the full flash
                                    concept without having to scrap it as a story direction, which would
                                    have been a pretty significant architectural upheaval. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now that it&#39;s out there, we can examine the pros and cons of delivering
                                    it that way as opposed to flash. (But note, no matter what, there was no
                                    chance of that flash getting made whatsoever. This is really not about
                                    &quot;what could have been&quot;)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Pros of flash:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Would have been WAY MORE RADICAL (frankly I don&#39;t care much about
                                    this. the rad quotient of preceding flash material is already pretty
                                    high, and there&#39;s plenty more combustible shit to come)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - The idea as a whole would have been delivered in minutes, rather than
                                    weeks, giving people the full sense of the story development all at
                                    once, and limiting the drag on the serial readers&#39; experience, and
                                    corresponding vocalization of those frustrations (would have been BY FAR
                                    the biggest advantage of flash)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Cons:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Concept as a whole may have been a bit challenging to parse with
                                    visuals alone. The two parallel battles are easy enough to understand,
                                    but I can easily imagine confusion over the alternate timeline concept
                                    as conveyed only visually. People have been confused by less. Much, much
                                    less.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Difficulty factor. Even with art contributors. There&#39;s a limit to not
                                    only what I can do personally, but what a largely unstructured volunteer
                                    effort can accomplish as well. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Hiatus-induced suicide pact among readership.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Pros of narration:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Get to experiment with a little parallel storytelling, via the top banner. (pretty
                                    big plus, IMO!)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Having it narrated removes ambiguity about a fairly cerebral chain of
                                    events, while allowing the chance to indirectly develop Scratch&#39;s
                                    involvement in the story a bit.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - I get to take my time with it and pretend to function like a normal human being

                                    - Slow rolling the segment page by page has serial readers agonizing
                                    every step of the way over every conceivable issue, on points of
                                    execution, unwelcome &quot;story developments&quot;, and so on. Once again,
                                    Homestuck is RUINED FOREVER! Until it isn&#39;t, of course.<br>

                                    - If you&#39;re not into Scratch as a character or don&#39;t like his tone or
                                    the whole omniscient smartass thing, then you probably aren&#39;t digging
                                    the arc much. Not much to say about this. It&#39;s just a &quot;you like it or
                                    you don&#39;t&quot; kind of thing.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Altering the flow of the story always carries the risk of agitating
                                    some readers. Not only because mixing shit up = automatic complaints
                                    (which is definitely true), but because by accelerating the pace to make
                                    broader narrative strokes, you are inviting the usual objections
                                    fixated on showing vs. telling. But I think there are some legitimate
                                    gears of storytelling which involve showing by way of telling outright,
                                    as long as the reader has the patience to see it through to its
                                    conclusion (problematic serially, as usual). It&#39;s a gear in which bigger
                                    story chunks that normally are given strong magnification (like a
                                    death) are told more compactly and in succession. These bigger chunks,
                                    when stacked up, &quot;show&quot;, or more appropriately &quot;reveal&quot; an even bigger
                                    idea which is at the true heart of that narrative stretch. It&#39;s not the
                                    event which the reader momentarily feels &quot;should&quot; expand to fill the
                                    stage, like a death. The death that with hindsight functions as a
                                    building block of a more complete idea which more effectively serves the
                                    story as a whole, completing unfinished arcs, building on the themes
                                    and such.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You can look at story pacing like rolling a Katamari ball, with respect
                                    to the granularity of what has focus. At the beginning of HS, I&#39;m
                                    rolling it around and picking up nickels and buttons. That&#39;s when John
                                    messing around with cakes and such has focus as actual plot points. The
                                    ball keeps rolling until points like that are too marginal to zoom in
                                    on, and he&#39;s exploring a mysterious oily land killing monsters and stuff
                                    while we gloss over a lot of detail that in an earlier mode would have
                                    received intense scrutiny. We are picking up things like traffic cones
                                    and bicycles with our katamari ball, while still sculpting a shape that
                                    as a whole resembles a story. Hivebent was rolled with even bigger
                                    denominations, maybe cars and trucks, gobbling up even bigger chunks
                                    like buildings by the end of the arc, as Aradia was offhandedly
                                    mentioning how they killed the king and created a universe. With
                                    hindsight we see why, understanding the overall purpose that arc had for
                                    the story, and how that particular pacing supported that purpose.
                                    Unlike Katamari though, the ball does get smaller sometimes, to go back
                                    to accommodating certain levels of detail like conversations and game
                                    mechanics, but it never dials all the way back. Doc has rolled with some
                                    of the biggest chunks yet, like buildings or mountains, casually
                                    dropping the deaths of characters as atomic features of his narration.
                                    He clearly rolls the ball smaller at times too, when he wants. But this
                                    construction too has purpose, which needs some patience to watch it take
                                    shape and then hindsight to fully appreciate.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And like I&#39;ve suggested before, these can be pretty disastrous
                                    conditions for the serial intake of a story. But honestly, there is no
                                    other way to do it. To strive to satisfy serial readers all the time is
                                    to do nothing but make something terrible in the long run. It means you
                                    can&#39;t do much to set up anything sophisticated with deferred payoff, as
                                    you perpetually submit what will immediately gratify. I can&#39;t tell
                                    people that reading serially is the &quot;wrong&quot; way to read it, because this
                                    is not true. But there&#39;s no escaping the fact that having pages leaked
                                    out so slowly radically warps your perception of what is happening,
                                    sometimes for the better (community discussion, noticing details etc),
                                    but often aggravates (arc fatigue, rushing to judgment...) Try to
                                    imagine watching your favorite movie, for the first time ever, but only a
                                    minute at a time, every day. Sound frustrating? How often do you think
                                    you might get irritated with the director for his pacing decisions? Or
                                    his &quot;plot twists&quot;, which are really just the products of scenes cut
                                    short before fully paying off? How often do you think you might want to
                                    insist he move it along? What about reading your favorite book, but only
                                    receiving about a paragraph or two every day? And what if the
                                    author/director was tuned into the responses to this daily output? Is
                                    there anything he could do to outrun the impatience of the reader for
                                    plot points he&#39;s carefully set up to be evaluated in the minute-space of
                                    archival read-through, which the reader labors over in the month-space
                                    of serial digestion? Can he do anything to deflect or mitigate their
                                    rush to judgment of incomplete arcs? Should he? Probably not. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The pages spanning the two links above provide a pretty good example of
                                    how serial intake messes with perception, and of why authors tend to
                                    like to finish books before showing them to you. Now that it&#39;s all
                                    there, let&#39;s look at the reasonable serial reactions to some key
                                    moments, and compare to the reality in hindsight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Terezi flips coin, Vriska flies away.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Serial reaction: augh, anticlimax!!! All that build up, the stair
                                    climbing and show downing and coin flipping... where&#39;s the battle?
                                    Where&#39;s........ SOMETHING?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Reality: This was only the beginning of a deferred resolution to the
                                    ongoing Terezi/Vriska rivalry. The resolution was actually the full
                                    sweep of this series of events in totality, resulting in Terezi looking
                                    into the doomed timeline to find the rationale and the courage to kill
                                    Vriska, which she finally did. All that buildup was not for that
                                    one-page deflation, but this full sequence. Reservation of judgment was
                                    required, something that is much easier to practice when there are more
                                    pages to click on.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    .....<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I could go on but I just realized I&#39;m tired of typing. But really, the
                                    list goes on and on like this throughout the whole story. Things which
                                    come off as odd or vaguely unsatisfying or even JUST SO TERRIBLE in the
                                    short term, but make sense and work better overall in the big picture.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You could complete this exercise yourself if you felt like it. Look at
                                    an event, remember how you felt on reading it live, and now how you view
                                    it in retrospect. Or, for extra credit, imagine you could wipe your
                                    memory of the past several months of content, and pretend I just posted
                                    it all today. What would your reaction be? How does it read? Do the
                                    issues which seemed to loom so large in the moment, like the omnipresent
                                    &quot;get on with it&quot; factor, even cross your mind for a second during such
                                    an archival dump? And for extra extra credit, imagine wiping your memory
                                    of all of Homestuck, and I just dropped it all in your lap right now
                                    while you were idling musing what sort of thing I might work on after
                                    Problem Sleuth. What do you think? Of it in totality, and of recent
                                    events? What is there that wears thin, on its own terms of pacing,
                                    rather than that dictated by two years of attrition on one&#39;s ability to
                                    remain completely engaged and cognizant of all relevant threads?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is a lot to think about when you make a story. Not just in how to
                                    make it, but in how it is absorbed. One story is really two completely
                                    different stories. The one that is read all at once, and the one that is
                                    read over your shoulder while you make it.

                                    cease and desist order? Or if you sell an HS sketch at a convention,
                                    will I hunt you down, kick over your table, and then muss up your hair
                                    and stomp on your glasses?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    No, that would be silly.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just clarified what the official position is, which is that you
                                    shouldn&#39;t attempt to profit from my work, or anyone else&#39;s for that
                                    matter, unless you have permission. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m suddenly outraged
                                    people are doing HS commissions and stuff. I&#39;ve previously taken an
                                    ultra passive attitude to all this. But the result of that, as well as
                                    the result in HS&#39;s growing popularity, has been a surging culture of
                                    casual copyright violation, which though seemingly harmless case by
                                    case, in totality is starting to look problematic. In particular, it
                                    seems to be leading to increasingly flagrant violations here and there,
                                    things which are more serious than a simple commission, and which I
                                    would be inclined to take measures to stop. It&#39;s easy to see how this
                                    trend develops. Someone notices wave after wave of HS artwork being sold
                                    by others, and presumes it&#39;s ok to take it a little further. And then
                                    further...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think it&#39;s better to address this before it turns into a bigger
                                    problem. Honestly, the theoretical money I am losing is not what is
                                    motivating me here. When you do an HS commission, I can&#39;t really imagine
                                    how that translates to dollars leaving my pocket, other than projecting
                                    losses in the very big picture if stuff like that goes unchecked. It&#39;s
                                    mainly a little unsettling to watch so many people at once act so
                                    casually about profiting off another&#39;s IP without asking, and even more
                                    unsettling to imagine it spiraling out of control. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It may be the case that a sketch of a Pokemon sold to your friend is an
                                    unenforceable violation, and Nintendo will never get involved, but it is
                                    still technically a violation. Please understand the fact that it is
                                    unenforceable does not make it less of a violation. You have profited
                                    from Nintendo&#39;s property, without permission. Which is not to say there
                                    are not degrees of violation beyond this which are more flagrant, but we
                                    should be clear about it. Knowing that, you might decide to do it
                                    anyway. Or you might decide to ask Nintendo permission. (They would say
                                    no. I might not, though.)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Requiring you to ask permission isn&#39;t much of an imposition. But I
                                    hesitate to guarantee satisfaction even if you do, because for one
                                    thing, your email might slip through the cracks and I might not get back
                                    to you. It&#39;s happened before. I&#39;ve had requests like this, and some
                                    I&#39;ve responded to favorably, while others I didn&#39;t get around to
                                    replying to. Which I feel bad about, as I generally feel bad I can&#39;t
                                    answer all my mail, but that&#39;s how it goes. All I can say is, if you&#39;re
                                    wondering, ask. I may say yes. I may say no. I may not respond. If I
                                    don&#39;t, then you may use your discretion, while understanding the
                                    position I have taken. If you cross a line, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll
                                    hear from me eventually. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;d rather this not be about finding out exactly what I do or don&#39;t
                                    allow, and then just getting down to furiously attacking that wiggle
                                    room I give. I&#39;d rather it be about respect for the property of artists.
                                    Everyone who this affects is an artist as well, presumably. If you&#39;re
                                    an artist, you should care about this topic and evaluate your standards,
                                    because you are undoubtedly hoping others will respect your work and
                                    your rights as well. Imagine you are at a convention, selling Pokemon
                                    drawings or such. If you knew one of Nintendo&#39;s most aggressive lawyers
                                    was lurking nearby, would you still do it? Is it fear of being
                                    prosecuted that motivates you to stop? Or is it the fact that you do not
                                    own Pokemon, and though it belongs to a multi billion dollar company
                                    that won&#39;t feel the slightest hardship because of you, it doesn&#39;t seem
                                    right, because these aren&#39;t your creations? Or maybe it is less about
                                    respect to the original creator, and more about taking pride in selling
                                    what you have created yourself, or at the very least, that which you
                                    have been given the right to?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And if the idea of selling black market Pokemon stuff makes you feel
                                    uncomfortable, where the owner has millions of dollars applied to a
                                    legal staff interested in crushing IP violations no matter how well
                                    intended, then why would you feel better about selling stuff owned by a
                                    guy without a tiny fraction of those resources, who has heretofore shown
                                    not even the slightest interest in taking action against his
                                    enthusiastic fans? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    These are things for you to think about, and then act according to your
                                    internal compass on the matter. I am not going to TAKE YOU DOWN if you
                                    sell a sketch of a troll to a friend or whatever. I&#39;m just letting you
                                    know my position, and will be reasonably content to let the fans govern
                                    themselves, unless certain lines are crossed. Then we will talk.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    As for the Formspring Question of the Day...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually, before I die, I would like to somehow, some way, get my hands on that
                                    god damn fucking tiger.

                                    I am of the opinion that the garments are ideal as they are.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A truly authentic god hood, with a long, darker blue hood, and short
                                    sleeves, would be a costume. It would not be a garment most people would
                                    actually be interested in wearing on a day to day basis. Some would,
                                    absolutely. The majority of interested buyers? Nope, especially
                                    considering what it would cost.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To manufacture such an item in a significant volume would be so complex,
                                    it would take a very long time, and would cost a fortune. It&#39;s hard to
                                    express how absurd this undertaking would be from my standpoint, and the
                                    standpoint of good business practice.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am sorry the reality does not match your expectations. They would be
                                    reasonable expectations if Homestuck was a property of, say, Disney. And
                                    the top Disney honcho could make a call to the guy in the Chinese
                                    factory which Disney undoubtedly owns and say &quot;Hey, let&#39;s make a million
                                    of these.&quot; and have that operational agility, and ability to make it
                                    cost effective through outrageous volume. Unfortunately, Disney doesn&#39;t
                                    own Homestuck yet.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So what you see is the best possible shirt in the real world, but also
                                    by any standard I think. It is pretty close to the shirt in the comic,
                                    while still being a very normal, wearable garment that doesn&#39;t make
                                    people feel like they are trucking down to the local anime convention
                                    whenever they leave the house in it.

                                    Everything I read about it indicated it was a feature, and

                                    But maybe this tip would have been the workaround? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I don&#39;t know. If I&#39;d unearthed that info while messing with it I might have run with
                                    CS5. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But really all that stuff wasn&#39;t just about how dumb I thought CS5 was.
                                    Long story short, I spent way too long trying to get CS3 to work, tried
                                    out CS5 for a bit, bailed on it, then fixed CS3. Now it&#39;s pretty much
                                    ok.

                                    I don&#39;t. Bear in mind, the time required was only part of the equation. There&#39;s also
                                    the effort.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The planned animation would have been a major escalation in production
                                    value. The sophistication of the animations has increased over time, and
                                    part of the point of this for me is to keep pushing the envelope, but
                                    there are limits to how far you can go. It&#39;s good to keep pushing and
                                    find your limits and test them, but realistically you&#39;ll have to pull
                                    back at some point. Because that is what a limit is. A line between
                                    something you can do, and something that is literally impossible.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not saying the animation I had in mind was impossible, but it was
                                    approaching scary territory. I just made a judgment and decided it
                                    wasn&#39;t worth the energy, all things considered.

                                    TOO BORING; DON&#39;T READ.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Seriously, don&#39;t read this. It&#39;s so boring.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A couple weeks ago my computer broke so rather than go through the
                                    rigmarole of getting it back up and running I just bought another cheap
                                    computer and copied all my shit over to it to solve the problem as
                                    quickly and painlessly as possible so I could just keep working. That
                                    went ok.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This as I said tends to be what I do when I run into technical problems
                                    rather than bang my head against the wall for days with diagnostics and
                                    part-swappings and repairs, and so I can just keep working and doing
                                    stuff that&#39;s actually important instead of dicking around with
                                    electronics.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Maybe it sounds wasteful but it isn&#39;t. I just use the old machine as a
                                    spare computer, after fixing it up GRADUALLY, at a leisurely pace, where
                                    doing so will not present an obstacle to continuous work. So that&#39;s
                                    what I did. But in this case, I liked my old machine better than the new
                                    one, so once it was fixed up and ready to go, I prepared to make a
                                    quick hop back over to old machine and keep the new one as a spare. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Except the hop wasn&#39;t quick, for one reason. Photoshop and Flash didn&#39;t
                                    work after installation. (the whole CS3 suite, actually) Still not sure
                                    why. At this point I&#39;m guessing the installation file got corrupted
                                    somehow in all the shuffle. Of course the road to understanding you&#39;re
                                    dealing with a very serious problem is paved with all these excruciating
                                    diagnostic measures, like uninstalling/reinstalling CS3 a dozen times
                                    and even reinstalling Windows a few times in 32 and 64 bit mode to make
                                    sure something like that isn&#39;t fucking up the works. Particularly
                                    maddening since I JUST INSTALLED it on my new machine a couple weeks ago
                                    and it worked fine. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And this kind of shit is exactly why I don&#39;t fight with computers
                                    anymore, I just replace them. Except that policy is really difficult to
                                    put into play in a situation like this, where the software is at issue
                                    regardless of what machine you use. But actually, I did investigate this
                                    approach anyway. It&#39;s just a more bitter pill to swallow because Adobe
                                    CS5 (their latest, solely offered version) costs literally five times
                                    what my computer cost. So I thought, maybe that&#39;s ok, maybe this is a
                                    good time to upgrade even if it&#39;s ridiculously expensive. So a good
                                    chunk of time I spent looking into CS5, downloading the trial and all.
                                    Photoshop CS5 is a very nice program, pretty elegantly designed, but I
                                    discovered it has one hideous flaw that makes it practically unusable to
                                    me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you use Photoshop, maybe you know about it. I&#39;m getting the sense it bugs a lot
                                    of people. It&#39;s summarized here.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php/t-899953.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php/t-899953.html</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    When I use Photoshop, generally I have 5 or 10 or even 20 documents open
                                    at all times. Actually, they&#39;re always open, even when I&#39;m not using
                                    PS. This is how I work on Homestuck, I just have a ton of pertinent
                                    files open all the time so I don&#39;t have to spend as much time rooting
                                    around for stuff. Having all those files clog up the taskbar is moronic.
                                    The &quot;tabbed documents&quot; system is just as moronic, for my process.
                                    Tabbed web browsing is a brilliant innovation. Tabbed PS document
                                    navigation, not so much, since many PS users like to be able to look at
                                    more than one document at once, side by side. Not sure why the
                                    developers thought they struck gold with this feature. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wouldn&#39;t give a shit about any of this if they just made these
                                    features optional, and allowed CS3-like behavior to exist. And I might
                                    even make an attempt to get used to it, if Adobe wasn&#39;t asking for
                                    nearly $2000 for the suite (or $1700, for just Photoshop + Flash CS5).
                                    I&#39;m not going to pay that kind of money on something that just makes me
                                    angry to use. Adobe seems to think I&#39;ll be delighted to whip out my
                                    credit card for the privilege of a mandatory workflow overhaul. Think
                                    again bros.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually I just gave up on the CS5 idea, and after undergoing a whole
                                    lot more terribleness too boring to mention, I finally just got CS3
                                    working again instead. So that&#39;s that dumb story.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was all pretty aggravating and exhausting, and kinda made me lose
                                    my train of thought on the story. Piling this on top of other recent
                                    disruptions like traveling and the preceding technical bullshit doesn&#39;t
                                    help much. Constant forward motion on the story tends to be what keeps
                                    the thing living in my head, and I&#39;m finding if you stack up enough
                                    major interruptions, it isn&#39;t just lost labor time that accounts for
                                    delay, but disrupted inspiration, as I have to completely regroup on
                                    what the fuck I was even thinking before shit hit the fan. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And it doesn&#39;t really help that it&#39;s a fairly delicate part of the story
                                    where the point is to wrap up a lot complex stuff in some kind of
                                    sensible way, rather than the typical mode of casual meandering, where
                                    we could hop over to some funny conversation that isn&#39;t particularly
                                    important otherwise and I could just say, There, there is your content,
                                    enjoy. It&#39;s really the perfect storm of built up story complexity,
                                    commitment to a methodical resolution of everything, radically
                                    rethinking long-planned points of execution (i.e. axing huge flash
                                    plans, figuring out how to structure/convey them statically), and a
                                    disastrous series of technical disruptions. Updates just can&#39;t push
                                    through this any faster than they are right now.

                                    I drew an initial template, and the art folks were invited to
                                    continue in that style, adding new animation frames, characters, etc.
                                    All very loosely, without a lot of parameters beyond that. Eyes5 did the
                                    Jack, myluckyseven did a Rose frame. There should be more to come.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was originally going to be a Flash project, but I cancelled it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Everything happening now, and over the next bunch of pages, would have
                                    taken place in a pretty energetic, and much more sophisticated than
                                    usual strife animation. Kind of like &quot;strife version 2&quot;, for the second
                                    disc. I planned this idea months ago, not really thinking much of the
                                    effort and time it would eventually require to complete. This is what I
                                    usually do, blithely make such ambitious plans, pay the price later, but
                                    fight through it with a major grind and honor the original vision.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was a little different though. Not only was this meant to be a much
                                    more elaborate type of animation by my own stakes-raising declaration,
                                    with more frames-intensive visuals like a typical 2D fighter, but on top
                                    of that, the rate of output had been slowing, and the story flow was
                                    already kind of logjamming. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So I had to make a decision. I could either apply what I now estimate
                                    would have been two or three solid weeks of serious effort to make this
                                    one pretty cool animation, and watch several 100K people sink into a
                                    state of despair over the prolonged suspension in content only to have
                                    the story advance not particularly far through a totally radical battle
                                    scene, or I could scrap the whole plan and figure something else out.
                                    The latter is what you&#39;re seeing.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sometimes these adjustments have to be made. I&#39;ve revised plans before,
                                    and had some cool ideas I&#39;ve scrapped. I was going to include another
                                    round in the Dave vs. Bro battle where they used their Sylladexes to
                                    wage a hashrap battle (which is why I went to the trouble of making Dave
                                    collect all that dangerous shit in his kitchen before climbing to the
                                    roof). But I axed that because the battle was already taking too much
                                    time to produce and bottlenecking plot advancement. That idea was pretty
                                    easily phased out. This is different now, because revising these plans
                                    meant I had to change the way a large chunk of the story would be
                                    delivered, because a lot of story components were all tangled up in my
                                    plans for that animation. So I had to do a lot of rethinking, and much
                                    of the solution is what you&#39;re seeing now, which is having the scratched
                                    disc interfere with the flow of the story, and Scratch taking over
                                    narration duties at an accelerated pace while he fixes the disc in time
                                    for the end of act. This is in part my way of committing not to doing
                                    anymore flash stuff until the EOA, which itself is going to be a very
                                    laborious thing and will take a long time to finish.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is all fine. I don&#39;t mind turning my plans upside down sometimes,
                                    since it can lead to creative opportunities for handling this stuff. The
                                    disc errors, Scratch hijacking the site design while narrating, all
                                    this strikes me as in keeping with the spirit of the story and the
                                    flexible format. Keeping the story moving is important, but it&#39;s not the
                                    sole consideration. MSPA for me is about working with loads of fun
                                    ideas, both for the story itself and the way it&#39;s told. Very often that
                                    consideration is at odds with pacing. I do what I can to balance both.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The biggest challenge in this respect by far has been Flash. I&#39;m quite
                                    ambivalent on its role in Homestuck. On one hand, it completely changes
                                    the way the story is read and perceived, for the better I think. It
                                    brings a lot of the most important parts of the story to life, makes for
                                    significant dramatic impact when needed, and goes a long way in making
                                    this difficult to classify as a medium. One the other hand, it magnifies
                                    the production complexity exponentially, and I&#39;m not just talking about
                                    the effort the animations require. It affects everything about my
                                    approach to the story. Including the whole decision making process, and
                                    not in a particularly good way, at least not from my perspective.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The biggest way it affects the process is how it stretches the story
                                    out. If I&#39;d gone through with the axed strife animation, that would be
                                    an obvious example, pausing the story a couple weeks to make some people
                                    fight. But the delaying effects can be more subtle than that. I&#39;ll have
                                    in mind a certain event in the story which I think should be handled
                                    through Flash. I&#39;ll know it&#39;s coming up, but I might not be ready to
                                    launch into that kind of work for whatever reason. Maybe it&#39;s too soon
                                    on the heels of the last one or whatever. So I&#39;ll work on more static
                                    panels, because there is never a shortage of plot threads to address or
                                    details to develop or funny conversations to write or new fun ideas to
                                    put out there. And that&#39;s fine really, since I feel like it&#39;s all good
                                    stuff, but it definitely makes for the long road. I&#39;m quite sure
                                    Homestuck would be finished by now if I&#39;d never used flash at all.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are other weird ways it factors in, like certain expectations it
                                    creates. Once it gets in the readers&#39; heads that it&#39;s a recurring device
                                    for the story, they start to look out for it and expect it in certain
                                    situations, compare static content with flash, consider how awesome some
                                    static panels would have been if done in flash or how awesome situation
                                    X will be if animated with song Y. The potential for disappointment
                                    looms constantly with increased expectations. None of this is
                                    particularly bad, but if you&#39;re the guy responsible for putting together
                                    this story, you tend to be keenly aware of it, and it factors into the
                                    big puzzle of managing it all. And a big part of that puzzle has been
                                    answering the question &quot;to flash or not to flash?&quot; <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;ve said before, the deeper into this I get, the less I feel like a
                                    writer or artist, and more I&#39;m like a producer, managing story decisions
                                    weighed carefully against cost of execution. And cost can mean a lot of
                                    things. Effort needed, organizational complexity (usually most present
                                    in interactive pages), time delay or obstruction to story advancement,
                                    stuff like that. This kind of thing doesn&#39;t factor in if you&#39;re writing
                                    something more conventional, like a book. You write in exactly what
                                    serves the story, as you envision it. It may sound crazy that&#39;s not what
                                    I&#39;m doing, but it really can&#39;t be anymore, not with these high octane
                                    animations in the mix as part of the expected delivery. I have to think
                                    like a producer to make that work. To understand what that means, here&#39;s
                                    an anecdote about Indiana Jones, which might not be quite true but
                                    whatever, it&#39;s just something I&#39;m vaguely remembering. When Spielberg
                                    was going over the script with somebody, it called for a pit full of
                                    lions, and he said &quot;whoa! too expensive! let&#39;s go with snakes.&quot; So you
                                    got Indy afraid of snakes instead of lions, because it turns out you can
                                    buy crazy loads of snakes for bargain bux. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It would be really reasonable for him to be afraid of lions though. They
                                    are huge and hungry and fucking terrifying. Have you SEEN a lion???
                                    Lions would be my quirky phobia if I was a rugged dude with a whip and
                                    longing for treasure.<br>

                                <p>
                                    I am not trapped in Canada. I got back on monday night. The
                                    grumpy customs guy looked at me suspiciously and considered the threat I
                                    posed to this nation for a little while, and then I guess finally
                                    decided to do me this rad solid by letting me back into my own country.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Toronto Comic Arts festival was fun and I met lots of cool people. I
                                    lost track of how many buckets I was asked to sign I think after the
                                    fourth bucket or so. One time a guy asked me to fill his bucket with a
                                    clear fluid he supplied, so I did, and the undertaking was filmed,
                                    probably for distribution on the amateur pornography market. Some people
                                    kind of tried to sing to me once, and I rewarded their ring leader with
                                    a bottle of Faygo (a crate of which was given to me as a gift. I can at
                                    this point count on gifts of Faygo, Gushers, and candy corn at any
                                    convention with total certainty.) The fellow opened the Faygo with
                                    showman&#39;s aplomb, and the bottle snorted an angry, umbrella shaped jet
                                    of atrocious cola on to himself, his belongings, and all who surrounded
                                    him. I showed my contrition by looking suitably horrified. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The convention only occupied the weekend, but in truth its footprint
                                    spanned 5 solid days when you account for travel time on thursday and
                                    monday, horsing around in Toronto on friday, and may even span 7 days
                                    when you consider how useless a person can be on the days before and
                                    after traveling extensively. So that is an entire week existing as a
                                    black hole in my creative schedule on account of two pretty decent days
                                    in Canada. This is probably why I don&#39;t do a lot of cons.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    On the subject of momentum killers, the preceding weekend my computer
                                    broke, so I bought a new one and spent time setting it up. I don&#39;t ever
                                    try to fix computers anymore. I just buy new ones, and copy my files
                                    over. I&#39;ve learned not to fight with computers over the years. Expending
                                    the energy to win these little skirmishes is not worth the years it
                                    shaves off the end of your life. It steals a lot of time just to
                                    diagnose problems, let alone agonize through solutions. Paying for
                                    service and new parts and such also takes time, not to mention money
                                    which could be applied toward a brand new computer which doesn&#39;t hate
                                    you yet. You should take my advice. The next time some device gives you
                                    problems, don&#39;t fight with it. Just acknowledge to the device, &quot;You win.
                                    You are broken. You will be replaced immediately.&quot; This is a liberating
                                    policy. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The thing is, a computer isn&#39;t even very expensive. You can get a pretty
                                    alright one for like $300 or $400. My disc drive failed. Yes, a
                                    scratched disc. We&#39;ll forgo mention of HS themes cropping up in my life
                                    cause I don&#39;t even know what to say about that. I&#39;ve had drives fail
                                    before, which basically happens for no reason. It&#39;s something they do.
                                    It&#39;s a good thing nothing important depends on hard drives being
                                    reliable. Except I guess practically all of modern civilization, but
                                    whatever. So I&#39;d have to buy a new hard drive for $100 or so, a fuckin
                                    copy of goddamn Windows (which I don&#39;t even have, I always just inherit
                                    OS&#39;s from new machines) for like $200, and jump through all these hoops,
                                    or just spend approximately the same amount of money on some dumb
                                    pre-assembled machine off a store rack that is hot and ready to go, and
                                    remain blissfully uninvolved with a piece of technology&#39;s staggering,
                                    intractable neurosis. I just copy my files over. When a drive dies, it
                                    never actually spoils your data much. It only ever seems to break just
                                    enough to make the OS go funky, and difficult/impossible to boot up. And
                                    the more you run it, the more it corrupts, which is why you stop
                                    immediately, forfeit all hope of salvaging it, and buy a new computer. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even though that was about as painless a solution as possible, it was
                                    still a significant momentum drain, and last week was pretty slow
                                    content-wise. So&#39;s this one. Momentum drags are pretty common these
                                    days. That&#39;s just the shape of things, and it&#39;s all been fastidiously
                                    filed under Oh Well already, so don&#39;t worry.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    TCAF amounted to about a week long black hole of output, through which
                                    not only did you get to not read anything, but I was not even remotely
                                    applying effort toward something you will read later. That effort begins
                                    only now, as I get my shit together, and puzzle over the plans I left
                                    dangling. These plans are usually kept rational and aloft in my mind
                                    through perpetual, feverish creative activity. They begin to resemble
                                    the overambitious boondoggles they truly are when I&#39;m forced to slow
                                    down. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What I&#39;m presently puzzling over is why I decided to leave a Flash
                                    project for myself to return to. Not really the best idea. But it&#39;ll be
                                    done when it&#39;s done, even if the gap in the archive from 5/5 to 5/? will
                                    probably seem cavernous relative to the eventual payoff. <br>

                                    All I&#39;ve really been up to is not working on it 24/7. Not
                                    working on a thing 24/7 shouldn&#39;t really need an explanation. Like
                                    nobody goes up to you and asks you why you aren&#39;t working on a thing
                                    24/7, because that&#39;s a nutty thing to ask someone. Unless you have
                                    trained a very large population to expect this behavior from you over an
                                    uninterrupted period spanning three years. In which case my strong
                                    advice to such a person who has done that is: ???????????????<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The animation took 4 days or so, but really it wasn&#39;t especially long
                                    and something like that should have taken me about 2 days or maybe less
                                    if I were working in Hell Mode. But I had a lot of other important
                                    things to do which stretched out the time. For instance, watching some
                                    episodes of 30 Rock. I also ran some unsuccessful errands, like I went
                                    to the UPS Store to mail my stupid broken iPhone back to Apple, because
                                    it&#39;s dumb and broken and I kind of hate it. But the UPS Store&#39;s computer
                                    wasn&#39;t working or something, so I left. I went back again another day,
                                    but it was the same story. I muddled around with some tweens and and
                                    cajoled a billion little image files, saved in photoshop one by one and
                                    imported into Flash which is technology on par with a broken iphone in
                                    terms of raw aggravation factor. I went to Starbucks a bunch of times
                                    and bought some coffee, and at one point I netflixed Robocop on the PS3,
                                    and wound up fast forwarding through all the scenes where he was
                                    sitting around without his helmet on looking weird and talking about his
                                    robofeelings, because the movie wasn&#39;t really as good as I wanted to
                                    remember it being. I horsed around with some cats, by which I guess I
                                    mean coexisted with them which is mostly all you do with a pet
                                    ultimately. The younger one has taken to nursing on the slightly not as
                                    young one, which is weird because she is like her adopted older sister
                                    who is barely even much bigger than her. But the older one seems fine
                                    with it and actually starts purring, because pretty much every cat in
                                    the world is as least partially insane. At some point I realized I
                                    should stop shitting around and get down to fucking business. I dug deep
                                    down to tap into my inner reserves of determination and strength, and
                                    with all of my mettle brought to bear on the task I buckled down and was
                                    finally able to watch another 10 or 15 episodes of 30 Rock.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And then I finished the animation.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    As for what I did today, i.e. the day after posting it, I don&#39;t know.
                                    Mostly sitting around thinking about how I want to execute some stuff
                                    coming up next, and revising some overly ambitious plans which were
                                    certainly made in the heat of labor-addled delirium. Also I did some
                                    other stuff. I made some pasta, and drove some cardboard boxes
                                    somewhere. <br>

                                    To be fair, if I were working at &quot;normal speed&quot;, updates over
                                    the last 5 days could easily have been compressed into one day. I kinda
                                    doubt anybody would be urging me to get on with it if that were the
                                    case.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Regardless, here is some additional perspective on the matter of the pressing need
                                    for plot advancement.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Do you recall that at one point, WV spent about three weeks fucking
                                    around with cans in a bunker before he finally blasted off? In Act 1, we
                                    watched John launch cakes out of his sylladex for two months before we
                                    even discovered the story had a plot.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is how this works. At times it advances through stretches of
                                    unremarkable events wherein characters are given space to fool around.
                                    The story then continues to build on the details that accumulate. That
                                    is how every story on this website has been created, and the practice
                                    has been adhered to religiously. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sometimes, even in the heat of my most productive periods, these
                                    &quot;goofing around phases&quot; still represent a kind of decompression. When I
                                    am just not quite ready to ATTACK major plot advancement in the manner
                                    that it would require, and it&#39;s simpler and more sustainable to mess
                                    around, do silly things, and keep production relatively light weight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I remember when WV was horsing around with Can Town, there were similar
                                    murmurs of impatience, and many believed firmly it couldn&#39;t possibly be
                                    going anywhere that served the story. Nobody could know his big can in
                                    the desert would blast off soon, let alone that a year later, for
                                    reasons they couldn&#39;t yet fathom, thousands of teenagers to smear gray
                                    makeup all over their faces because of stuff that happened in this
                                    story. What could possibly happen later that would cause this??? Pretty
                                    hard to imagine, when you&#39;re the guy in December of &#39;09, impatiently
                                    waiting for WV to eat parts of a pumpkin, drink Tab, and play chess with
                                    himself.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To find out, you had to be in it for the long haul, as you must now be. I
                                    will do what I am going to do, and one way or another, it will get
                                    where it&#39;s headed. It always does.

                                    I didn&#39;t even name the Midnight Crew. The name was submitted
                                    through a donation command before Homestuck. I named and designed the
                                    members of the group to complete the request. It began here, and there
                                    are several others.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    Like many things in donation commands (zillyhoo, doomsday dice
                                    cascader...) the MC was adapted into Homestuck through the elaborate
                                    plot devices you may recall, driven by the usual MSPA meta-humor which
                                    you have grown to [feel some way about], which at this very moment
                                    continues unabated. (Remember the MC was introduced in HS as the MSPA
                                    adventure the kids could read if they visited MSPA.com. Then it turned
                                    out that MSPA was, in a way, a viewport into the troll universe, where
                                    the MC was real, and consisted of Jack &amp; co. as exiles on Alternia.)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But I didn&#39;t know about the Morton song until Radiation adapted samples from it into
                                    Black, which accompanied [S] Jack: Ascend.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    The song was recorded 100 years before HS began. There&#39;s not much info
                                    out there on the guy or the song. Would anyone be all that surprised if
                                    it was released on 4/13/1909?

                                    I don&#39;t know. I hardly ever read more than half way down the first page of
                                    questions. Too many, too repetitive, etc.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But through various channels, I detect certain flavors of reaction,
                                    ranging from disappointment to frustration to something faintly
                                    resembling outrage, not just at the lack of an incendiary production to
                                    mark year 2, but also the flagging rate of output in recent weeks.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    These reactions are far from universal, but they exist, and to address
                                    them I think an education on why MSPA exists at all is in order. If you
                                    see a creator who begins to languish in production of what presumably
                                    accounts for his day job, the impression may be that he is falling down
                                    on the job and failing to live up to his professional commitment. So
                                    maybe this is the source of indignation, re: entitlement, that some may
                                    feel when my output falters. The problem is, MSPA is not a day job for
                                    me. It is an all consuming lifestyle. Hence, the mirage that is the
                                    apparent ease of output for what is at times ludicrous volumes of
                                    material is highly sensitive to even slight perturbations in my life
                                    situation. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let me put it this way. You may work a full time job. It may be that
                                    something happens in your life that makes your job more difficult,
                                    because you are preoccupied. Your work may suffer to some extent, but
                                    you can still approximately match what&#39;s expected of you, because there
                                    is a partition between your job and your home life. You may nevertheless
                                    feel your full time job seems to dominate your existence, saps your
                                    energy, and leaves your weekend respites feeling all too short. This is
                                    not an experience I share, because MSPA is not a full time job. If you
                                    have such a job, then I would have to RADICALLY REDUCE my workload to
                                    match your level of day to day preoccupation.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The actual quantities involved have always been nebulous and I never
                                    made a point of keeping track, but 12 hours per day seems like a pretty
                                    reasonable average, since that is just shy of all waking hours. Time
                                    spent writing, drawing, animating, or just spacing out at my monitor
                                    while contemplating all the moving parts. This is what I did every day,
                                    including weekends and holidays, for two years, and to some extent
                                    another year prior to that with Problem Sleuth. Only a few weekends were
                                    missed due to conventions, and there was a single week off immediately
                                    following the infamous &quot;robo smooch&quot;, and that&#39;s it. (Most of that week
                                    was spent wondering why the hell I wasn&#39;t updating...) There are other
                                    gaps in the archive, spanning days or a week, when I was animating.
                                    Those spans involved the usual work schedule, while simply omitting
                                    sleep!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not only is this an unreasonable workload to expect of anyone, it&#39;s
                                    practically impossible to pull it off. Maybe you can expect some
                                    committed guy out there to really buckle down and duplicate that effort
                                    for a month or two. But years? Too much can crop up in the white noise
                                    of normal life to destabilize it. Momentum is absolutely crucial for
                                    maintaining that kind of pace. I find that if I only do an hour of work
                                    in a day, I get ten minutes of work done. If I do 12 hours of work, I
                                    seem to get 24 hours of work done. This is especially true of animation.
                                    Such projects notoriously take a very long time. I feel like because of
                                    the crazy head of steam I&#39;ve built up from years of nonstop effort, I
                                    can knock out in days something that might take another animator a week.
                                    Or in a week what might take a month. Without that momentum, it&#39;s not
                                    possible. Starting up Flash cold is excruciating. Getting your head back
                                    into the stride of a story wastes energy you wouldn&#39;t use if you never
                                    broke stride. Without the momentum, the pace reverts to ordinary.
                                    Getting distracted by life destroys the momentum. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;ve been pretty zealous about deflecting the distractions, even when I
                                    move, as I often do. A notable example was last year when I came back
                                    from the Emerald City con in Seattle, and found my apartment flooded.
                                    The con was already enough of a time sink, so I didn&#39;t have much of an
                                    appetite for going into personal crisis mode. I just kind of shrugged,
                                    picked my computer off the lone, miraculously dry part of the floor,
                                    dropped it in a temporary residence, and kept drawing. I think the flood
                                    mess occupied about a day of my attention, whereas something like that
                                    could easily take up weeks of your time and energy if you&#39;re living that
                                    &quot;normal life&quot;. You know how it is, you come home and find water up to
                                    your ankles and go aw fuck, what&#39;s ruined, what needs replacing, gotta
                                    call whoever and deal with the fuckin landlord about stuff and auuuugh. I
                                    just didn&#39;t bother with any of that, because it just didn&#39;t seem to
                                    matter, and I preferred to keep working and not give a crap about all my
                                    soggy bullshit. And in retrospect, I guess it really didn&#39;t matter. <br>

                                    All of my moves have been similarly characterized by the unceremonious
                                    transportation of a computer and a few boxes to a new room, in which I&#39;d
                                    continue working as if no change took place, with no service paid to
                                    the life that would be lived there, except as a workspace. I moved again
                                    recently, prompted by decidedly less dramatic and less soggy reasons
                                    than after Emerald City. This time, for whatever reason, I did it
                                    differently. I moved the normal way, the way I imagine normal people
                                    doing when I close my eyes, whereby more than a car trunk full of
                                    utilitarian belongings are imported into the household, placed on the
                                    floor, and never unpacked until the next moving day. I am not
                                    necessarily PROHIBITIVELY busy, but like I said above, any dent in the
                                    momentum, whether its a few trips to Home Depot or Target here and there
                                    or somehow waking up to discover I&#39;d absconded from a shelter with two
                                    particularly energetic young cats, is something that precludes a pace of
                                    output that is insane and often bordering on miraculous.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    What I&#39;m trying to convey here is this isn&#39;t necessarily any sort of
                                    break, or a grand announcement of a big slowdown for MSPA. I&#39;m trying to
                                    give you a sense of the reality which made MSPA heretofore possible,
                                    and that if for a period of time I descend from an altitude far
                                    exceeding the hours of a full time job, into &quot;merely&quot; those of a full
                                    time job, IT DOESN&#39;T ACTUALLY COUNT AS A BREAK! And certainly not as any
                                    sort of violation in a pact with the readership. Different from what
                                    you&#39;re used to? Sure. But you should never find yourself in a position
                                    where you come to expect, let alone demand, that degree of effort from
                                    anyone, even me. If my output &quot;sputters&quot; from 10 pages a day to 1 or 2
                                    or 3, IDEALLY (re: unrealistically) this should not even cause you to
                                    voice an internal observation on the matter! And if one is voiced,
                                    instead of &quot;oops, looks like Andrew&#39;s slipping,&quot; it should be &quot;oops,
                                    looks like Andrew&#39;s being a regular dude for a while.&quot; <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that detecting a pace change is some terrible wrongdoing, since
                                    clearly I&#39;ve done everything in my power to establish these absurd
                                    precedents, and people have naturally associated this with The Brand.
                                    I&#39;d just like to suggest it would be beneficial to the reader to
                                    disentangle enjoyment of the content from the torrid pace its been
                                    commonly delivered. Who can say how fast or slow it&#39;ll come in year
                                    three? Would my assurances even be reliable? Maybe it&#39;ll stay at the
                                    current pace for a good long while. Maybe it&#39;ll soon hasten back to
                                    something more typical. Maybe it&#39;ll come back FASTER THAN EVER. Who
                                    cares??? Do you really NEED this site to be the fastest comic on the
                                    block to enjoy it? Are you prepared to contend with the backlash to your
                                    psyche that is risked by so fervently relishing that particular
                                    property of the comic? What if it&#39;s taken away? Don&#39;t go boasting to
                                    your neighbors that your slave can pick cotton ten times faster than
                                    theirs. It&#39;s unbecoming. Just enjoy the fluffy yield of his furious
                                    hands, while you wait and pray for Abe Lincoln to gently stroke his
                                    beard and relieve you of your bigotry.

                                    Primarily it is that Jeffrey Rowland of Topatoco and I think
                                    that making these terrible shirts is hilarious, and we are both willing
                                    to hinge our entire business models on the production of gag merch.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But this does not mean I made these shirts INSTEAD of other cool HS
                                    shirts. You will note that there is a separate store called What
                                    Pumpkin. This is the store I use for the rather extensive collection of
                                    potential HS merch when we get the time to make/restock it.
                                    Realistically, there are just too many possible HS products to bug
                                    Jeffrey with all the time, since he is servicing about 30 other webcomis
                                    too, so generally I reserve WP for these ideas, while keeping Topatoco
                                    mostly about PS stuff, and now it seems SBaHJ stuff as well.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There&#39;ll be more HS stuff in the WP store pretty soon, plus a restocking of what&#39;s
                                    there.

                                    Where is trolling involved when Dave makes self-aware references to the
                                    callback heavy style of the story&#39;s construction? Where is the intent to
                                    agitate? There is no editorial subtext. There is nothing to read
                                    between the lines. There is no veiled repudiation, and I am not saying
                                    &quot;suck it bitches!&quot; to those who disagree with the callback saturation
                                    (those people don&#39;t even exist). It is merely a couple of lines of
                                    dialogue which are silly and self referential. It is a joke.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It is also not trolling when I leave something on a cliffhanger. It is
                                    standard dramatic practice. It is also fairly unavoidable when there are
                                    many story threads running at once. You have to switch to others at
                                    some point. You also cannot answer every question at once or distribute
                                    every payoff when they are demanded, or a very nonlinear story would
                                    become very linear very quickly. It is additionally unavoidable because
                                    there are few occasions when you don&#39;t want to know what happens next.
                                    Hence every switch of focus begins to resemble a cliffhanger. This
                                    pattern has also been brought to attention through self aware humor, a
                                    la 5x cliffhanger combo gags and such. This does not count as trolling
                                    either. These are yet more gags of self reference. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are some moments when trolling comes into play. When tension
                                    mounts in a scene and we are being lead to expect something significant,
                                    and then you read the word &quot;psyche&quot;, that is clearly a form of
                                    trolling. When I am dressed up as a troll, and copying large volumes of
                                    text into the narrative specifically to spite you, the reader, and I am
                                    saying &quot;I am trolling you right now by doing this&quot; it is safe to say you
                                    are being trolled. And even this flagrant gesture is one step removed
                                    from the act of genuine trolling, through the partition of satire. The
                                    entire concept of trolling has been folded into the story as another
                                    source of raw material for absurd kinds of exploitation, like computer
                                    science, alchemy, sprawling chess metaphors, and suit-based alien
                                    romance. This does not mean every joke is an act of trolling, or
                                    meta-trolling. In fact, very few are. When you read a simple
                                    self-referential joke or have your expectations subverted in in some way
                                    and say HUSSIE&#39;S TROLLING US AGAIN, you sound silly. You sound like you
                                    don&#39;t understand what trolling is, or what I&#39;m actually doing here.

                                    These key dates have actually become EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to nail as the
                                    complexity of the projects increases. Problem Sleuth was very easy to
                                    key into exactly one year, because the increments were so much simpler.
                                    That year-run was the precedent that began most of this milestone
                                    madness, and I&#39;ve kept up with the milestones for the most part, but
                                    they start slipping over time. I&#39;ve already blown a few and had to
                                    readjust.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Remember that [S] Descend (end act 4) was originally targeted for
                                    4/13/10, but I ran out of time (EXACTLY like I am now) and I put [S]
                                    Jack: Ascend on that date instead. Descend got pushed way back because
                                    there was no reason to push it so hard anymore. It dropped around June,
                                    then Hivebent started on 6/12, which is now ANOTHER key date!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Things tend to take longer than I think, whether it&#39;s a single animation
                                    task, or the execution of a string of story events, which are necessary
                                    to complete to set up other major events like an end of act, and so on.
                                    Meanwhile, time just rages on. I remember thinking at the beginning of
                                    &#39;11 that there seemed like plenty of time to set everything up to end it
                                    on 4/13. Lo and behold it&#39;s already fucking april! We&#39;ve made plenty of
                                    progress, but it&#39;s still not there.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Try to remember that as a key date approaches, I actually have much less
                                    time to make that work than it seems. To make 4/13 work for EOA5, I&#39;d
                                    need AT LEAST a solid week to work on it, probably more. Which means I&#39;d
                                    have to get the story up to that exact precipice in less than a week
                                    from now, and frankly, I&#39;ve got other shit to do. As it is, I&#39;ll be
                                    lucky to pull off anything of significance on the strike of 4/13, let
                                    alone the monstrosity that the EOA would inevitably be. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It&#39;ll be just like EOA4 (Descend). It&#39;ll only happen when it can feasibly, logically
                                    happen.

                                    It was originally going to have another scene following the
                                    stair climb, but that turned out to be too much to cram into one page,
                                    and I thought it would have delayed the the release of the page too
                                    much. It had already been delayed enough, not only by the labor involved
                                    in making such a thing, but by the fact that I&#39;ve been pretty busy
                                    otherwise. This was not blasted out at the usual rate, neither by me nor
                                    Gankro (the programmer). We both had stuff to do.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I decided to separate the following segment onto another page to follow
                                    it shortly. It only seems abrupt because you cannot yet turn the page. I
                                    think this should be obvious.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you&#39;re reading a novel, you would never say &quot;man, I sure did enjoy
                                    page 386. Page 386 was just so awesome until it ended abruptly! What
                                    gives??&quot; What gives is that page 386 ran out of paper for words, and the
                                    story continued to glide seamlessly onto page 387, for those bold
                                    enough to turn and continue reading. Even for those who bookmarked and
                                    continued a couple days later! Single pages do not give you all the
                                    answers you want, nor do atomic story units in formats less
                                    conventional.<br>

                                    Critical thinking is really important for navigating this website.

                                    Sure. And I think this is because of the diversity in the story.
                                    I think if I wanted to do something more formal, that stays in more
                                    clearly defined lanes like strictly humorous or dramatic or such, that
                                    work would be stronger because I&#39;ve already tried so much with this. I&#39;d
                                    just have to reel it in. There are many things going on here that you
                                    would never see in such a work. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m sure some look at the diversity of what&#39;s here, perceive various
                                    violations in literary protocol, and regard this as evidence of
                                    storytelling deficiency on my part. Which is fair, because you can only
                                    go on what you see. But at the same time I do have a grasp over what
                                    I&#39;ve made, and have the awareness to apply more focus to a work than
                                    what&#39;s projected through this wide aperture. When tightened, most of
                                    those violations would vanish.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not trying to make the best thing ever here. Only something which is
                                    very fun, extremely flexible, and serving to accelerate my abilities,
                                    my understanding of what a story can be, and my grasp on how people
                                    react to things. That is actually a valuable part of the exercise,
                                    watching mass reactions in real time, on every aspect of each update.
                                    From the minutia, to the big plot turns. There is a very real component
                                    of this that resembles a huge social experiment. I&#39;m not just putting
                                    pressure on the limits of a story&#39;s format. I appear to be doing this
                                    with the psyche of the readership as well. I have discovered many
                                    obscure buttons which can be pushed. I am taking extensive notes.

                                    Calling it a strategy would probably be making too much of it. <br>

                                    I&#39;m working on a project, and I&#39;m compelled to drop every cool idea I
                                    have into it. I horse around with format, and break or bend many rules
                                    on story construction purposefully. This includes infusing it with meta
                                    elements. The meta-saturation of the story continues to fuel my
                                    interaction with the readers, and listening/responding to them probably
                                    keeps the relationship between the narrative and the reader still
                                    feeling like it is an open channel, even though suggestions have been
                                    closed for a while.<br>

                                    Everything going on here is experimental and vigorously informal, and this is the
                                    consequence.

                                    The main purpose of it was not the assurance, but to establish the

                                    I think there is definitely hyperbole that gets thrown around
                                    when discussing my ability, and I think people tend to drastically
                                    underestimate how ridiculously good the various masters were at their
                                    crafts.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In fact, I really don&#39;t even view myself as a writer. I view myself as
                                    more of an illustrator who tells stories, and uses as many tools at my
                                    disposal to do so. Writing is one. Drawing and animating are others. The
                                    act of telling a story is in essence writing, so that&#39;s clearly what
                                    I&#39;m doing, but it&#39;s still hard to feel like this describes my primary
                                    discipline. I&#39;ve always identified myself as an artist foremost, who&#39;s
                                    had to push into the territory of a writer and develop those skills out
                                    of the necessity that follows unchecked creative ambitions.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I also think there&#39;s the risk of media-chafing when selecting such names
                                    for comparison. Those writers were established in very formal literary
                                    traditions. I wonder what it would look like if you took one of the
                                    names you mentioned, dropped him in this period in his prime, and
                                    assigned him with a project similar to this? Some satirical, slapdash,
                                    media-blurring THING, heavily illustrated and published as fast as it
                                    was made with little revision? What if Vonnegut wanted to do that,
                                    bought a Wacom and boned up on Flash, and was TURNED LOOSE? Would he
                                    knock your socks off? Maybe!!! Kind of interesting to think about.

                                    It would make a very good song for an animation, but it is
                                    looooooong.....................<br>

                                    So like a bunch of songs I like, it&#39;s either butcher it, or leave the visuals to the

                                    But the silent Flashes in question are very short. There are no
                                    suitable songs on hand for things like that. Shortening songs often
                                    feels like butchering them to me.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This issue is a little more complex than just saying &quot;hey slap a song in there, why
                                    not!&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Practically every song available already is a pretty long composition,
                                    which requires an intensive animation project. I prefer to be sparing
                                    with those, because they are difficult. If I make a very short Flash in
                                    lieu of a GIF, there will not be a song ready that is suitable. I can
                                    get someone to make something for it in advance, but that takes time,
                                    and defeats the spontaneous, rapid fire nature of such updates.
                                    Musicians can make suitable tracks after it is finished and posted, and I
                                    can go back and &quot;retcon&quot; it in. And I HAVE done this before!!! But I
                                    don&#39;t know if I want to make it a policy. It doesn&#39;t feel right slapping
                                    sound on everything retroactively simply because I can.

                                    I find it much more understandable for someone to read SBaHJ and
                                    not be into HS. Reading and appreciating HS is a very intensive process
                                    which requires a lot of time and concentration.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Whereas reading HS while not studying (yes studying) SBaHJ is less
                                    forgivable. SBaHJ is requisite supplementary reading. If HS was a class,
                                    I would automatically fail anybody who didn&#39;t get an A on their SBaHJ
                                    exam.

                                    SBaHJ is absolutely inseparable from HS, and has been almost
                                    from the start. If you don&#39;t understand this, then you don&#39;t understand
                                    HS very well. SBaHJ is like the mentally handicapped step brother of
                                    MSPA, requiring special attention, but no less cherished as a part of
                                    the family. It was originally intended as the chief source of in-house
                                    memes for dialogue, but this is ultimately a superficial purpose. Though
                                    it only has 20+ strips, it contains a pretty dense and internally
                                    consistent language of recurring symbols and typo-driven grammars,
                                    applicable as a rich sub-cognitive lexicon for highlighting elusive
                                    elements woven into the mythology of the story which tend to be shrouded
                                    in the unconscious. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Many times events in SBaHJ &quot;foreshadow&quot; what happens in HS, but this is
                                    practically never intentional. It is always retroactive on my part, and
                                    quite convenient. Like the vampire strip I drew shortly before Kanaya&#39;s
                                    death and resurrection. The correlation was convenient, and was
                                    emphasized in the comic as a gag. Same with the one with Bro achieving
                                    LIFDOFF, passing a cloud labeled &quot;cloun&quot;. Soon after, John flew his car
                                    by a cloud that showed Gamzee in it. This was unintentional while
                                    drawing the SBaHJ, but the connection was soon made in the comic
                                    serendipitously. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    SBaHJ as a creative process is probably a pretty accurate reflection of
                                    my subconscious at work. This may be why it often ties into HS themes
                                    yet to develop. It is like I am a prophet of my own story, and these
                                    shitty comics are my cryptic messages. I submit to the trance of the
                                    JPEGothics, while quaking in the losseldritch throes of the artifact
                                    tongues. The resulting imagery is troubling, and AGGRESSIVELY PREGNANT
                                    with meaning.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Though most aspects of HS&#39;s story construction is exceedingly
                                    meticulous, with multi-threaded plot connections established months or
                                    years in advance, intuition plays a powerful role too, and may be even
                                    more important than the maniacal, overly cerebral stuff. There are
                                    occasions where something will just FIT, in a weirdly perfect way, even
                                    though I didn&#39;t quite intend it. I always seems to be working favorably
                                    with the grain of positive coincidence. Strange things with numbers
                                    happen all the time, for example, and this is certainly not because I&#39;m a
                                    skilled numerologist. The troll&#39;s number is 612 because I started
                                    Hivebent on 6/12, a tale of 12 6 sweep-olds (13 year-olds). Their names
                                    are 6 and 6 letters, like mine. Why is one sweep = 2.16 years? Weird.
                                    Why is 6/12/11 exactly one sweep from 4/13/09, the start date of HS???
                                    Also weird. These occurrences are everywhere, and I can only assume they
                                    have their root in the turbulent void from which all this comes. The
                                    story is in part driven furiously by high level cerebral machinations,
                                    and in part at the mercy of the whims of my waking coma. And I,
                                    personally, am at the mercy of it all.<br>

                                    Anyway, if for no other reason, this is why you should like SBaHJ, or at
                                    least find it intriguing. Frankly, I am quite suspicious of anyone who
                                    doesn&#39;t find it funny. I am suspicious of their judgment and quality of
                                    perception. This is probably because it means their minds are
                                    incompatible with mine on a such a profound level. They are at odds with
                                    my subconscious.

                                    I don&#39;t think I ever drop a major development which is
                                    spontaneous, though points of execution almost always are, which
                                    probably makes it seem more off the cuff than it is.<br>

                                    There is a lot to it. I don&#39;t have any trade secrets at all, but
                                    if I did, it would probably be the process I apply to those images.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    One major tactic: save as jpg, reduce quality to zero, but DON&#39;T SAVE IT
                                    YET. Instead, screen capture the preview. Then paste that into the same
                                    document, and repeat this process for a while, until you have grown the
                                    desired amount of &quot;loss scum&quot;.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But this just keeps making the image foggier, which isn&#39;t good enough by
                                    itself. After that, I usually apply other effects, like strategic
                                    sharpenings and other misc. filters. I also use a lot of masking through
                                    color range selections, and perform meticulous alterations at the
                                    pixel-cluster level.

                                    I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the opposite, but it&#39;s obviously intended
                                    as an absurd transformation to specifically complement Kanaya&#39;s.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    &quot;Going grimdark&quot; is a phrase which itself is silly enough to qualify as a
                                    joke. The ramifications of such a transformation are surely on par with
                                    becoming a glowing Twilight-esque vampire called a rainbow drinker. And
                                    yet, silly though these developments are, no one can argue they are not
                                    awesome as well. The result is the magic which takes place when stupid
                                    meets badass.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The whole &quot;going grimdark&quot; thing was something discussed by readers when
                                    Rose first started stirring things up with her dark magic. The whole
                                    issue was later lampooned somewhat in a conversation with John. In fact,
                                    practically every line of the recent updates have been callbacks to
                                    this conversation. <br>

                                    I found the point of controversy kind of funny. It makes one wonder,
                                    what does &quot;going grimdark&quot; even mean? Is that even a thing? I guess it
                                    is, as long as we understand that it probably refers to the
                                    metamorphosis of a vanilla character into a brooding gothic cliche, and
                                    this is something played absolutely straight in things which are
                                    generally terrible. Please note it is not being played straight in this
                                    case. [AND YET IT IS. WINK.]<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also, who here is keeping tabs on super hero references??<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Rose&#39;s shirt has somewhat resembled the Punisher&#39;s logo for some time
                                    now, without any reason to link her to the vigilante. Let us now note
                                    the origin of the Punisher, a guy spurred to vengeance after watching
                                    his family get brutally murdered.

                                    There was a small liberty taken with perspective.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you look at the beam of light coming out of the record, that beam is
                                    pointing straight up. If skaia were directly above that record, the beam
                                    of light would lead to it. It doesn&#39;t.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Skaia is directly over Dave&#39;s house. She is looking at it from a vantage
                                    similar to how we&#39;d view the north star. But again, with some
                                    perspective liberties taken.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is because it just reads better this way. Our understanding is, skaia is &quot;up&quot;.
                                    To go to it, you fly up. <br>

                                    The problem with topics like this is that it takes way too long to

                                    There&#39;s plenty of merchandising going on, but I honestly never
                                    make story decisions with the idea that it&#39;ll make me tons of extra bux,
                                    even though it seems like it with all the rad marketable clothes these
                                    dang kids are wearing all the time. I just do what I think is cool and
                                    feels right at the time. I have never once done something and said YES
                                    THIS WILL SELL SO MUCH MUSIC, or said FUCK I GOTTA DESIGN A SHIRT LOGO
                                    THAT&#39;LL SELL LIKE HOTCAKES.<br>

                                    Silent flashes aren&#39;t actually new. Just haven&#39;t had many in a while. Remember pages
                                    like this one?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002401" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002401</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    With these little Rose flashes, I just thought the idea would be a
                                    little easier to get across with a short flash than a series of gifs.
                                    They were not really long enough in my mind before execution to warrant
                                    finding a clip, or asking someone to make something beforehand.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The one where she looks in the cue ball wound up being a little longer
                                    than I thought it would, just to pace it right, and I certainly COULD
                                    have given it some track with suitable ambiance, but I sort of
                                    deliberately checked that impulse.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just don&#39;t think that necessarily EVERYTHING is going to benefit from
                                    sound, even though it sure looks like that&#39;s the pattern I&#39;ve
                                    established. If every time that preloader pops up, even if only to serve
                                    a 15 second clip meant for sequential utility, and we&#39;re hearing a tiny
                                    mood setting score or little sound effects each time just cause that&#39;s
                                    what a flash Has To Be, then it feels like it&#39;s getting into hokey
                                    territory to me. For the larger cinematic pieces, yes those absolutely
                                    need sound. The mini ones? Ehhhh, not so much. In any case, the
                                    expectation that sound must be delivered with flash or I risk violating
                                    my rules is something I find a little bothersome.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The line has been pushed very far into some vague mediaspace frontier.
                                    But now and then, I like to remind you that the story still includes
                                    every possibility up to that line, including the more primitive things
                                    far short of it.

                                    I understand what you mean, and thanks, but I guess there are different types of
                                    &quot;wow factors&quot;.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    At this point I believe the kind you are talking about is a typical
                                    reaction to something with strong cinematics conveying interesting
                                    developments. That&#39;s cool and all, don&#39;t get me wrong.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The kind I was talking about was more palpable during ones like WV:
                                    Ascend, where the reaction is based on lack of precedent, and the
                                    reaction is something like &quot;I didn&#39;t know this could be that.&quot; Some
                                    successive ones had that feel too, like Descend probably, and the first
                                    Alterniabound probably did too somewhat, in that the format was such a
                                    curve ball. Innovation is still possible, but like I said, there is some
                                    element of diminishing returns to this kind of thing. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not saying this quality is essential to preserve in continuing that
                                    kind of output, but its evaporation in a project like this does steal a
                                    liiiittle motivation for going to the bother. Like I said, I&#39;ll do them
                                    if I get an idea that sounds like a fun and a worthwhile way to apply
                                    time. Which actually isn&#39;t much different from how I&#39;ve been doing it
                                    lately anyway.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And somewhere in this equation is the fact that at some point this thing
                                    does have to GET MOVING, and Flash projects have notoriously
                                    bottlenecked story progress behind them.

                                    Let&#39;s try to come to our senses here. The labor involved in
                                    making a Flash animation is pretty goddamn ridiculous. I&#39;m approaching
                                    the 2 year mark on Homestuck, and in addition to the thousands of static
                                    pages and many tens of thousands of words, I am standing on several
                                    hours of animated footage. This is, frankly, ludicrous. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that there is any regret in this accumulation. But after a point, an
                                    assessment has to be made whether such sustained high intensity is
                                    worthwhile, and whether it continues serving the purpose it originally
                                    had. It&#39;s purposes being media exploration, pushing the envelope on
                                    story delivery, and so on. The envelope can&#39;t always be pushed farther
                                    while still justifying the effort. If the effort required increases,
                                    while reader reaction inevitably flattens and adjusts to the
                                    expectation, then that particular purpose is not really being satisfied
                                    anymore. As far as media exploration goes, I think there&#39;s probably more
                                    than enough dynamism in the animated portion of this work to cover my
                                    initial agenda for it (which is to say, it far surpasses it). And as
                                    reader reaction catalysts, they probably stopped having the eye-widening
                                    impact they once had, where they were very often transforming your
                                    understanding of what this story was, and what it could be, and catching
                                    people off guard by humbling what preceded it. Without that
                                    experiential payload, they become a part of a pretty homogeneous loaf
                                    that represents MSPA as a product, something that demands a consistent
                                    mouth feel when chewed, and Flash must be tasted before swallowed. This
                                    is a situation I am not HUUUGELY interested in committing all of my time
                                    to keeping propped up, and Flash animations were not actually meant to
                                    be part of MSPA&#39;s Pledge To The Consumer.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So all that&#39;s really left, and this has been true for a while I guess,
                                    is whether I feel like doing a Flash and whether I&#39;ll enjoy it. I can
                                    say that the end to every act will definitely involve a Flash animation.
                                    But beyond that, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s possible I might not do a Flash
                                    between now and the end of A5. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Or I might! We&#39;ll see.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But what might not be fruitful is trying to read the gaps in my schedule
                                    like tea leaves, and divine the nature of upcoming output. Often, in
                                    the Flash frenzied history of HS&#39;s reckless climb, interpreting such
                                    gaps in this way has been reliable. Maybe not so much here on out!

                                    I think the easiest way to address questions like this is to
                                    say, picture every possibility that is dumb and terrible. Those things
                                    are exactly what I am not going to do.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also, it&#39;s pretty amazing how often people misuse the term retcon. Almost as often
                                    as they misuse the word troll.

                                    Not exactly. The Rift was just what the trolls called the
                                    phenomenon that brought Jack to their session. It then became known by
                                    its formal name, the Scratch, as we learned a little more about what was
                                    going on. We learned the rift was actually called the scratch at the
                                    end of Hivebent.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The only aspect of this that was a red herring at all was the
                                    implication that the rift/scratch was some generic opening in spacetime
                                    that let Jack hop from one session to another. This is what the trolls
                                    presumed due to ignorance. Aradia knew what the scratch was (since she
                                    was the one who first mentioned it in her private memo), but she was not
                                    all that talkative as a mopey robot, and clearly didn&#39;t think it was
                                    important enough to let anyone know.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We now know the scratch isn&#39;t what transported Jack between sessions. We don&#39;t know
                                    what did yet.

                                    I don&#39;t have a formula for making likable characters. But I guess character
                                    development tends to help.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    With Scratch, I think one of the fun things about his recent
                                    developments is that they came on the heels of learning that he is part
                                    Cal. His identity as a creepy pervert wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;set up&quot; before
                                    this revelation. Not overtly. But if it was I think it would be less
                                    entertaining. We get to watch certain traits of his personality reveal
                                    themselves exactly when we now have reason to expect those traits. If he
                                    had them before it might have weakened the humor value of it now, even
                                    though it would have been more air tight from a characterization and
                                    plot construction standpoint. We didn&#39;t get to say &quot;DIABOLICAL! So
                                    THAT&#39;S why he&#39;s a perv!&quot; But HS has enough of those eureka moments
                                    already for us to be worrying about that.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that his developments are completely off the wall either. He was
                                    always a pretty self satisfied guy, with the demeanor of someone who
                                    could easily be a coy prankster, who just hadn&#39;t revealed those
                                    tendencies yet. Much of what he said had the feel of a knowitall who&#39;s
                                    just messing with someone. Also, he did only talk to the girls. With the
                                    exception of the one short line to Karkat. He manipulated them and
                                    mentored them in weird ways, and eventually one might ask, why all the
                                    attention on the ladies dude??? So turns out that&#39;s why, sort of. Of
                                    course the original reason was more pragmatic. It was just that of all
                                    the trolls, the ones most relevant and dynamic in the story tended to be
                                    girls, so that&#39;s who he talked to. But later, it struck me as a pretty
                                    amusing angle on an omniscient character to be a bit of a creeper, and
                                    this is in keeping with his origin. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Remember where Cal came from in the first place? And why he was thrown out of Dave&#39;s
                                    dream tower?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003621" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003621</a><br>

                                    But all that said I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite right to regard him as
                                    an actual pedophile, just because of what sort of entity he is. It&#39;s
                                    probably more apt to think of him as an all knowing supercomputer that
                                    happens to have a gravitation toward young ladies in his programming.
                                    Imagine walking up to the computer and if you are a boy it says, hey.
                                    But if you are a girl it says WELL HELLO, DON&#39;T YOU LOOK NICE. Thinking
                                    of it in these terms helps make it funny rather than outright
                                    disturbing.

                                    the Maid of Time, clearly. It has significance to Tavros and his
                                    interest in the Peter (Pupa) Pan mythology, and the phrase is
                                    unambiguously tied to the ticking clock in the belly of the crocodile
                                    who hunts Captain Hook. And Captain Hook has been unambiguously likened
                                    to Jack Noir and/or Vriska, who have both gone without an arm and an
                                    eye.<br>

                                    The words all have significance to Scratch as well. Tick tock because
                                    the guy is associated with a mob of time travelers, duh. Honk honk
                                    because the guy is essentially made out of a clown doll. Break heads?

                                    Since the thickest book by far is the ~ATH book, it stands to reason
                                    most of Scratch&#39;s DNA comes from the honk code. Bec&#39;s DNA comes from the

                                    A small exception to the pattern. But we can examine a few reasons why it makes
                                    sense.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Aradia&#39;s quirk is to replace &#39;o&#39; with &#39;0&#39;, making t0ck. Using a &#39;1&#39; for
                                    t1ck not only balances the numerology, but adds a binary element to the
                                    phrase. Duality/bifurcation has always been a strong theme in the
                                    trolls&#39; session. Two teams, two sets of ruins, two universes.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is also a pretty solid case to be made for why Tavros should
                                    represent 1. Aradia has always used zeroes because she had been the
                                    &quot;null character&quot;, before her resurrection. Sollux on the other hand had
                                    always been the character of duality, with his twofold curse. When
                                    Aradia came back to life, she lost her null quality, and thus lost her
                                    quirk. Sollux lost his twofold curse when he went blind, and lost his
                                    quirk too. But he, in a way, assumed Aradia&#39;s position as the null
                                    character, insofar as 2-2=0. He assumed her quirk. This is aside from
                                    the point about Tavros though. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you list the trolls according to the order of the zodiac, it starts with:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    0: Aradia<br>
                                    1: Tavros<br>
                                    2: Sollux<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That is, if beginning with 0, which is suitable for Aradia&#39;s theme, then
                                    Sollux is also numbered suitably as well. That makes Tavros the 1 troll
                                    by default. Does the number 1 have significance for his character
                                    beyond this? Bet you can think of your own reasons if I left you to it.
                                    Here&#39;s a pretty good one for me: Tavros is so lame, he&#39;s always
                                    forgotten to type with the number ruling his existence, and it is only
                                    through writing this code that the quirk has been awakened.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Vriska&#39;s number is obviously 8. Scorpio is in fact the eighth sign on
                                    the list too, assuming we switch to begin counting at 1 from the start
                                    in this case. Which we should, because we aren&#39;t actually being that
                                    literal about assigning a number to each troll. It only makes sense for a
                                    few of them. Some of their numbers don&#39;t even register on a 1-12 scale.
                                    Equius likes 100, while Nepeta is all about 33.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    8 has always been kind of a special number in HS, in the same way 413
                                    has, though not hit as hard as those digits have been. In fact, 4+1+3=8!
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    413 are Terezi&#39;s numbers. She uses them as her quirk, as the numerals of
                                    the blind prophets. If we are to say Vriska is 8, then Terezi is right
                                    behind her on the zodiac list, and she would be 7.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Her code &quot;H34DS&quot; conveniently includes no 1. 3+4=7!!! There&#39;s her number, rearing
                                    its head.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Where did the 1 go? Tavros has it! It seems writing these codes while
                                    sleepwalking has cajoled the true numbers assigned to Tavros and Terezi,
                                    1 and 7, out of their subconscious. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Ok, so some of this sounds a bit like hand waving I&#39;m sure. No single
                                    reason here is ESPECIALLY compelling for giving Tavros a 1 on its own,
                                    but I submit that we have overwhelmed the jury with circumstantial
                                    evidence, and I expect a conviction.

                                    No, not at Cal&#39;s conception. But at the beginning, that&#39;s not
                                    really how I worked. I littered the story with hundreds of details,
                                    knowing that some of them would rise to extreme significance later. The
                                    bunny was one such detail designed explicitly to rise to significance,
                                    though in a way left open ended. Cal was exactly the same. But for those
                                    who really understood my M.O., the moment you saw Cal, you probably
                                    expected nothing less from him.

                                    <br>
                                    All of the code fragments are maintained separately in different books.
                                    The books are deposited in the slot below, to the right. The machine
                                    knows what to do with them.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    Also note how much bigger the book slot is than the kid session slot.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    That&#39;s because the troll slot needs to be able to fit the huge ~ATH book in it.

                                <p>
                                    Ok, here is what I said about this in the forum.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    vvv<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Here comes the magic of logic.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Four codes does not necessarily mean a more complicated genetic code, or some kind
                                    of weird alien DNA.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Symbols are just symbols. With the MEOW code, the DNA letters were not
                                    literally MEOW. They represented GCAT. M=G, E=C, O=A, W=T.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Same with these codes, but more symbols can be mapped to GCAT at the
                                    same time. Like t1CK=GCAT, t0ck=GCAT, 8rk=GCA, H34DS=TGCAT. This will
                                    work as long as the total number of symbols is divisible by 4*.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The means of creating the code is more complex, but the code itself is not
                                    necessarily.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that I am expecting this to occur to most people though. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    *Addendum:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When I wrote that, the honk codes had not been revealed yet. So
                                    additionally, honk =GCAT, HONK=GCAT. An additional 8 symbols, also
                                    divisible by 4 to ensure balanced GCAT distribution. Each part is needed
                                    to combine to form what is presumably the equivalent of the MEOW code,
                                    once translated to GCAT.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This makes for a total of 24 symbols to complete Scratch&#39;s code. Is this
                                    relevant? Why don&#39;t I point this out. It&#39;s actually 2 sets of 12, one
                                    for each troll, and one for each ancestor, who were created all together
                                    in their session by Karkat. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you want to keep your theorist&#39;s cap on, you could then note that the
                                    MEOW code only consists of 4 symbols, one for each kid, but not for
                                    each guardian as well. It might suggest there are missing symbols, and
                                    we don&#39;t know the full story about Bec&#39;s origin. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It MIGHT.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Or might not.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I think this was pretty obvious a long time ago.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But then, homosexuality in a society where bisexuality is the norm is
                                    kind of a different thing. Rather than being a swapped preference, it is
                                    a more exacting preference. Somewhat like a fetish for a particular
                                    gender. When Karkat was talking to John about it, he indicated trolls
                                    don&#39;t even have a word for the orientation. It&#39;s not something that
                                    appears to have any cultural significance to them. Which might seem odd,
                                    but then, they&#39;re aliens. Maybe a way to view it is how we view people
                                    with more exacting preferences, like certain fetishists. We don&#39;t
                                    actually have common words to describe most people like that, and their
                                    presence doesn&#39;t have nearly the same social ramifications which
                                    homosexuality does. Humans seem to make a very big deal out of
                                    homosexuality, while treating other forms of preference as barely worth
                                    noting. When Karkat was &lt;3&lt; hitting on John, the reasonable human
                                    response was to say &quot;I am not a homosexual.&quot; But the troll response
                                    would be more like &quot;Sorry, not interested,&quot; without invoking
                                    orientation. Very much like a guy with a fat fetish isn&#39;t too likely to
                                    reject a thin girl by saying &quot;Sorry, I am just this HUGE chubby chaser,
                                    so I must decline.&quot; (CUE FAT VRISKA JOKES AGAIN)<br>

                                    Not that any of this changes how we view Kanaya. From a human perspective, she&#39;s an
                                    unmistakably gay character.

                                    MSPAspace is a pretty fast and loose kind of space. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I like to think the events you described would have taken a month to convey through
                                    a more typical webcomic.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And by that I mean what I just said is definitely true.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also a typical comic would not involve things that are as great as those things.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Basically I am saying there is a good reason why this is the only comic that you
                                    bother with.<br>

                                    I have this really strong hunch that people who think I pick out
                                    dumb questions have a really dumb idea for what constitutes a good

                                    It was intentional insofar as I was aware of the possibility of
                                    drawing attention to it for humorous effect, but did not.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There was already a Schrodinger&#39;s Dave joke earlier, and how much lousy
                                    Schrodinger do we even need? That one was funnier anyway, because it was
                                    Ricky Schroedinger&#39;s Dave, which is not actually funny to anyone who
                                    doesn&#39;t know what Silver Spoons was, which is probably most of you. And
                                    even then, it is only funny in conjunction with Terezi&#39;s breakdancing
                                    Schroeder gifs.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So what I&#39;m saying is the cat joke both exists and doesn&#39;t exist. It is in fact
                                    Schrodinger&#39;s Joke.

                                    But for the record she doesn&#39;t sparkle, she just glows like a goddamn
                                    light bulb, which is WAY more awesome than Edward turning into a walking
                                    blingee when he gets some sun. It also makes more sense because she is a
                                    reverse vampire on account of being a member of a nocturnal race. And
                                    it makes even MORE sense because it is a dig at Twilight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Stephenie Meyer can&#39;t even fall back on the Twilight parody excuse to
                                    justify her glittering vampires, because the thing she is writing is
                                    Twilight in the first place. I am going to email her my condolences.
                                    She&#39;ll probably think I&#39;m retarded though, sort of like how I feel about
                                    people who complain about my dumb shit on formspring. The only
                                    significant difference is that I&#39;m right, and she&#39;s boring.

                                    I&#39;m really baffled by the source of your confusion here, but the
                                    question seems to share a sentiment with some other weird questions I&#39;m
                                    reading which demand this [S] page should have gratified them all
                                    instantly in the exact way they desired, so I&#39;ll answer them
                                    blanketedly.<br>

                                    Have you ever watched a movie? Sometimes the setup is as important as
                                    the payoff. Ambiance? Tone? Suspense? Bringing to a more clear cinematic
                                    focus of prior events? Any of these things familiar?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If we chopped up an old western into pieces and distributed it daily,
                                    all those cowboy actors have to put up with Formspring questions yelling
                                    GET FUCKING ON WITH IT CLINT EASTWOOD. WE GET IT, YOU ARE STARING THE
                                    DUDE DOWN. Things take time to execute and deliver properly.<br>

                                    I think sometimes people think this site is this magic box that all this
                                    miraculous shit comes out of with no explanation or process behind it,
                                    but I do in fact have to spend time MAKING that shit. The more complex
                                    it is, and the more points of interest it resolves, the more time it
                                    takes. You wanted a fucking battle royale? Ok, get ready for a week
                                    without updates!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The golden goose is a great thing for everybody until down the road you
                                    discover you are that guy wringing the bird&#39;s neck screaming at it to
                                    lay you some more goddamn eggs you honking piece of shit.

                                    All of it was an accurate historical account of events from her
                                    perspective. She does not need to embellish on anything because she is
                                    the real deal. A very successful and nefarious troll pirate who exploits
                                    her powers in battle and romance.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is one of those things that is equal parts serious and silly (well
                                    ok maybe not totally equal). It is in part serious in the sense that you
                                    can view it totally straight and read it as a series of events that
                                    literally happened, and has implications for the story. It is also in
                                    part COMPLETELY FUCKING RIDICULOUS because you are truly, literally
                                    reading an excerpt of trashy romance, involving pirates like some Fabio
                                    novel, all parsed through a grim troll culture and the strange
                                    multi-dimensionality of troll romance.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once all the dust WTF settles, you can look at it from a variety of angles.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Since this is the ancestor Vriska idolizes, this is probably the exact
                                    type of character she&#39;d grow up to be, if left unfettered in troll
                                    society. If there is any departure in her inclinations, this is the
                                    template she is departing from. We&#39;ve already seen her try to do her
                                    Mindfang impression a few times with mixed results. She tried to get
                                    Tavros to kiss her with mind control, but couldn&#39;t go through with it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When put into the perspective of more severe adult troll attitudes, I
                                    think it helps make everything the trolls have done so far seem more
                                    childish in retrospect. It was hard to gauge, because adult troll life
                                    was completely abstract. Hearing a little from one adult&#39;s perspective
                                    through this romfic shows how big the gap was between their youthful
                                    antics and what they were really trying to become.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It also puts a little perspective on why certain relationships are the
                                    way they are, seeing how their ancestral counterparts interacted (in
                                    this case, Vriska and Eridan, whose ancestor was Dualscar, which was the
                                    name of his RP character as well). But we still only have the one
                                    example to go on so far.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And on the topic of Vriska reading this thing for inspiration, to me
                                    it&#39;s kind of got the feel of a cross between a kid learning about a
                                    relative she looks up to, delighting in reading some unapologetically
                                    trashy romance novel, AND the troll equivalent of stumbling on her
                                    parent&#39;s porn stash. Which is not to say the entire journal is full of
                                    smut. But hey, there it is.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And lastly, you can look at the log as further insight into the nature
                                    of troll romance, their near-universal bisexuality, their apparently
                                    casual attitudes toward the multiple partners the quadrants demand, the
                                    tension surrounding the potential of hopping quadrants and the meaning
                                    of envy in this regard, an element of mysterious affection that still
                                    seems to surround the hate-based black relationships, and a certain
                                    degree of open promiscuity implied by the actions here. IF YOU CARE!

                                    Well, if you have to force a punchline, then the punchline
                                    shouldn&#39;t even exist, should it? The whole comic shouldn&#39;t exist. By
                                    extension, there are entire webcomics out there that should not exist.
                                    (Won&#39;t say which ones tho! hehehehehehehehehehe.)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But really, one problem with normal comics I think is when you have
                                    pages chock full of panels, sometimes a lot of those panels just get
                                    glazed over by the reader as background wallpaper, even though they may
                                    be very attractive if examined, and a great deal of care was put into it
                                    by the artist. It&#39;s sort of a shame.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    With each panel given focus, they demand attention and can have more
                                    power individually, and create more surprising statements as navigated
                                    through. This is true even if one of my panels is literally just me
                                    scribbling bullshit all over it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And the real HAYMAKER of this format is being able to deliver any
                                    quantity of text below the image I want. Anywhere from 0 to 100,000
                                    characters. I can fit entire conversations in one panel which would
                                    require HUNDREDS of normal comic panels to convey gracefully. I always
                                    found dialogue-dense comics a bit offputting, wherein all the dialogue
                                    is stuffed into a lot of ponderous bubbles crowding out the art. With
                                    this format, this is not an issue at all. Large volumes of text may
                                    coexist with the art innocuously, as if you are reading a true
                                    comic/novel hybrid.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh yeah, + animation&#39;s cool too I guess.

                                    called &quot;Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art&quot;. One day I hope to
                                    write a book called &quot;Ruining Comics: Forever&quot;. It will be a 1000 page
                                    book, and every page will simply be a photograph of my face.

                                    Who says they serve the same purpose? Maybe they are glands for some

                                    The whiplash phenomenon is not limited to your perception of
                                    Vriska. It is a defining feature of the reading experience, especially
                                    lately. It&#39;s not a bad thing, in my view. One of the reasons you get on a
                                    roller coaster is because the experience is not exactly a gentle one.
                                    They build them in amusement parks, because that is where people go to
                                    be amused.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Vriska is not designed to be either definitively likable or hateable.
                                    Sometimes when you read a story, a character does something which you
                                    will take as a message from the author about how you are supposed to
                                    feel about that character. When they later do something at odds with
                                    that message, it can either be regarded as out of character, or
                                    character development, depending on both the reader&#39;s perception, and
                                    the author&#39;s execution.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this case, everything she does, good or bad, is meant to provide a
                                    more complete picture of her as a character, and more thorough context
                                    for her actions. Once upon a time, a lot of it seemed purely despicable.
                                    But I don&#39;t believe either extreme, despicable or sympathetic, is 100%
                                    suitable anymore. What exists is a portrait that has complexities, as
                                    any character given a lot of time in the limelight should have. That
                                    having been provided, which side she falls on is up to the reader.

                                    Nothing is ever drawn in advance. I draw a panel, and then post
                                    it. Or I draw a group of panels in succession, and then post them all.<br>

                                    funny. That is what it still is, in my view, which appears to differ
                                    with the reality inside your own personal factsphere. So be it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But using Problem Sleuth as a comparison is silly. Problem Sleuth had
                                    very little in the way of a plot, and the characters were mute foils for
                                    outrageous shenanigans. The dark events, which were rare, happened in a
                                    framework in which investment was limited. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Midnight Crew intermission would serve as a better comparison
                                    anyway, since it was essentially a bloodbath. But it&#39;s still the same
                                    kind of thing. Stick figure characters with no actual personality
                                    getting knocked off left and right for laughs. If you ask I apply the
                                    exact same standards of &quot;dark lite&quot; to HS, I say this is not possible.
                                    Killing a character beyond stick figure depth will necessarily carry
                                    more weight, and will be read by some as a turn for the GRIMDARK. So in
                                    truth your advice is to kill no one, and proceed gutlessly, or risk
                                    being likened to a comic book from the 1990&#39;s. I suggest viewing this as
                                    an attempt to be edgy and therefore artistic is a pretty shallow way to
                                    interpret what is happening.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Looking back on the MC intermission again, it was a pretty prescient
                                    segment. It foretold of a great deal of time travel complexity yet to
                                    come in the story. It turns out there was a bloodbath in the cards as
                                    well. There are many ways to examine past events and not be surprised by
                                    what is taking place now. Not the least of which is that these children
                                    were introduced as members of a race of psychopathic murderers. Some of
                                    your jaws still seem to be on the floor, and I guess I wonder what
                                    they&#39;re still doing there.

                                    I&#39;m capable of containing the impulse to do bizarre shit when I want to.
                                    If you look at some big stretches of Homestuck, you will observe
                                    something that is quite tame, often cutesy, and even at times bordering
                                    on accessible. But then, to create a well manicured and widely palatable
                                    product was never the mission here. It was about exploration, high
                                    diversity of concepts and execution and all that, and I guess above all,
                                    fun for me personally. (and YOU!) So there are vehicles built into it
                                    to support my more usual fare. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The primary vehicle for that was Hivebent, and the entire troll presence
                                    in the story in general. It began with a pretty messed up premise. The
                                    establishment of a colorful cast of kids from a violent race of
                                    psychopaths whose entire civilization centers around brutality and
                                    murder, and watching how kids from such a culture relate to each other
                                    and come of age. Hivebent began with dark notes relative to Homestuck,
                                    and only got darker. The scene with Vriska and Tavros in her quest
                                    cocoon was an example of the escalation in fucked up shit. Present
                                    events are even further escalation. It was always going to get much
                                    worse before it got better. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you got into this story more recently without knowing anything about
                                    me or what I&#39;ve done before, and feel the story would be better suited
                                    without the inclusion of the more bizarre elements, or the downright
                                    NASTYTIMES, all I can say is that&#39;s not who I am or what you signed up
                                    for.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Do you know about Humanimals? Probably most of you do. It&#39;s a comic I
                                    did years ago. I still think it&#39;s hilarious, personally. If you do too,
                                    then I would bet there aren&#39;t many ways in which our senses of humor
                                    differ. But to many it was disturbing, hideous rubbish. In truth, these
                                    comics are probably about as unsettling as you can possibly get without
                                    resorting to violent or sexual content. (if it appears sexual in nature,
                                    that is only your imagination at work, trust me)<br>

                                    [here&#39;s where this answer probably gets a bit too long]<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m constantly mining content from my older work to incorporate into
                                    Homestuck. The instances of this are hard to quantify. Let&#39;s talk about
                                    Equius again. Lot&#39;s of people thought he had depth beyond his gags, and
                                    that&#39;s definitely true. But that wasn&#39;t what was relevant about him, to
                                    me personally. He was always the troll personification of everything
                                    like Humanimals I ever did and put on the internet. (Hence is lusus is
                                    basically a Humanimal.) I used to do all sorts of weird stuff, reviewing
                                    obscene furry pornography, making weird collages involving horses, and
                                    just a whole lot of bizarre shit that didn&#39;t make much sense, but I
                                    thought was funny. The whole span of these endeavors was quite trollish
                                    in nature, and you will agree if you peruse Humanimals. The fact that it
                                    puts some people off is part of what makes it funny. So Equius was that
                                    entire arena of trollish content, rolled into a character. That&#39;s why I
                                    was STRONGLY committed to maintaining the integrity of his arc, as I
                                    defined it. It was more important by far for me to adhere to his role as
                                    the fucked up dude who embodies all that stuff than have him blow it by
                                    doing something heroic. He believed he died a death of supreme
                                    integrity. And so do I.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Don&#39;t get me wrong, he was still a gag character. But this was the
                                    precise nature of the gag, an homage to an entire vein of humor I used
                                    to deal in copiously. He, like some others, trolled you in life, and
                                    then trolled you in death. What happened in between, you ask? Well, that
                                    was just you falling in love.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Whistles was a graphic novel I did years ago. It&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve
                                    mined ideas from, which have specifically begun to show themselves
                                    lately with Gamzee&#39;s turn. And oddly, there&#39;s some of Whistles rolled
                                    into Equius too. If Equius seemed to accelerate to a point of depth
                                    faster than others, maybe it&#39;s because he was built on quite a payload
                                    of founding concepts, all revolving around perversity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Whistles was about a clown in a circus who was as sweet as could be. He
                                    loved his ringmaster, in spite of the fact that the master was a
                                    cannibal and a tyrant who attempted to kill him. When the circus
                                    rebelled against the master and beat him, Whistles flipped out, killed a
                                    lot of people, and absconded with the master into the desert. (nice
                                    clown going murderous is obviously what Gamzee imported from this) The
                                    recurring theme throughout the whole comic is that every time Whistles
                                    has a chance to do the right thing and rebel against his evil master, he
                                    can&#39;t overcome his loyalty to him. To the point where he offers his
                                    starving master his own severed arm to eat. The whole thing is darkly
                                    humorous and pretty messed up. Equius imported this insane reverence for
                                    the hierarchy at the expense of his own well being. Though with
                                    Whistles, it wasn&#39;t quite as perverse and didn&#39;t have the creepy sexual
                                    connotations. (However, at one point Whistles did dabble in
                                    prostitution. But when he did it, it was cute!)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I get asked sometimes if I will make book 2, the conclusion of Whistles.
                                    The answer is, probably not. It&#39;s incredibly time consuming making a
                                    graphic novel, and I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll find the time. It also
                                    probably just gathered too much dust for me to get into it again. But
                                    unlike Equius, I did plan on giving Whistles a heroic end. I always
                                    intended for him to overcome his obsession with his master.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For what it&#39;s worth, I did finish a draft of book 2&#39;s first chapter. It
                                    introduces a new villain named Sugarshoe who is, get this, another
                                    insane clown! If you read through this and recent HS events, it may seem
                                    like I&#39;m obsessed with this kind of thing. Not really. Like I said, I
                                    just borrow heavily from myself.<br>

                                    Just to wrap up this trivia binge, some other examples of old stuff I&#39;ve rolled into
                                    Homestuck are..........<br>

                                    SBaHJ. I did a few strips on a whim, satirizing someone&#39;s comics, about
                                    one month before I started HS. I folded it into HS as it&#39;s primary
                                    source of original memes to be referenced ad nauseum. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The whole Bro puppet obsession was largely sparked by this series of
                                    ridiculous muppet comics I did in the forum years ago. One of the comics
                                    actually made it in HS, pinned on Bro&#39;s door for Dave to find. File

                                    All the wizard stuff in Rose&#39;s house, and her wizardfic writing in
                                    general, was mostly imported from my own absurd wizardfic I wrote some
                                    years ago, a pretty healthy sized book I never quite finished. It was
                                    called Wizardy Herbert, and was a very flippantly satirical story about
                                    kids and magic, starting out as what seemed like an unapologetic Harry
                                    Potter spoof revolving around a magical summer camp instead of a school,
                                    and then quickly launching off the plot deep end into some very
                                    convoluted stuff of Homestuckian proportions. In fact, there are many
                                    ideas mined from this story and injected into Homestuck. Any time you
                                    read anything about magic being stupid or not being real or anything
                                    like that, that&#39;s Wizardy Herbert talking. Zazzerpan and his full
                                    Complacency were minor characters in WH. WH is actually extremely
                                    similar to HS, in terms of the nature of the dialogue, the blend of
                                    utter silliness and dramatic seriousness, and complexity. It feels like
                                    such a similar thing to me, this might be the main reason why I&#39;ll never
                                    quite finish it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Characters from WH are on Rose&#39;s wall here. <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002121" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002121</a><br>

                                    Herbert is the guy with the eye patch. He had a magic gun. But he could
                                    never figure out how to use magic, so he primarily just went around
                                    shooting things. <br>

                                    I was just providing some broader perspective. Often what you want the
                                    most will not actually serve a story that well, in the way it has been

                                    dialogue between him and Nepeta? Or more funny horse pun antics or
                                    whatever?? It just seemed so RANDOM! That was so cruel of you, and also
                                    horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE storywriting!&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    These question-grievances are always no win situations. There are so
                                    many conflicting objections, it&#39;s hard to take any seriously.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And this isn&#39;t even addressing the substance of the objection. So you&#39;re
                                    saying there is no purpose in characterizing someone who is slated to
                                    die? Pardon me, but that&#39;s idiotic. You say you don&#39;t understand the

                                    single Flash page, with several conversations? Seems like overstatement.
                                    As for the point of the Flash, how about fun? Entertainment value?
                                    Humor? Is any of this registering?

                                    Disappointing? I don&#39;t think so. More like suitable for everything we knew about the
                                    character. Which wasn&#39;t all that much. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was a character who was introduced with horse porn on his walls.
                                    His entire presence in the story was a gag. I think literally every
                                    conversation he had was centered around his obsession with the
                                    hierarchy, his perverse enjoyment in being bossed around by those under
                                    him, and his desire to be subjug(gl)ated by his only land dwelling
                                    superior. He mentioned he didn&#39;t think he could raise a hand to the
                                    highblood. When it came down to it, he couldn&#39;t, not even to save his
                                    life. Such was the extent of ridiculous submission fetish. He was
                                    devoted to the caste system to a fault, and he died for it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To be disappointed is to crave a more challenging or heroic death. Which
                                    I guess is fine. But to crave a scenario in which a more dynamic duel
                                    occurs and he rises as some sort of hero would be overestimating the
                                    relevance of an utterly marginal character, someone designed to be not
                                    much more than a really strange piece of an ensemble cast. What he
                                    contributed to that ensemble was, as I said, completely centered around a
                                    gag, and I stayed true to the gag to the bitter end. His death was as
                                    much a sight gag as his introduction. This effectively concludes his arc
                                    as a minor character. (OR DOES IT????)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think of the big picture, and like I say all the time, I consider how
                                    it reads straight through as opposed to dripped out tortuously for day
                                    to day analysis and second guessing. In the slow motion of present
                                    moment, the readers deal in countless WOULDN&#39;T IT BE COOL IFs, but each
                                    of those is lacking broader vision. I&#39;m the one keeping track of the big
                                    picture here, and if I happen to mention that Equius going out with a
                                    bigger bang would have been kind of dumb, like so many other things on
                                    people&#39;s wish lists, I guess you just gotta trust me!

                                    This question carries the bizarre implication that I make a
                                    habit of reading any other Formspring accounts. I find my own tedious
                                    enough to peruse as it is.<br>

                                    Also I think you&#39;ll find smiling at my answers more often will go a long
                                    way. In fact I am dismayed to scroll down and find all of my answers

                                    I am going to say that if all of the answers on this page have not
                                    gathered at least 1000 smiles each within 24 hours, I am going a

                                    I like that through formspring there appears to be emerging
                                    fanon-assertion that a room with two distinct points of exit is
                                    something that is necessarily less than logical.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It proves beyond question that there is absolutely nothing people will not take the

                                    It&#39;s pretty cool that google gives props to ff in this way. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It&#39;s also worth noting that none of those searches lead to any clear answers about
                                    ff or who he is.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I guess I forgot the point I was making.

                                    This seems like a preposterous thing to do. When the latest page
                                    is a big Flash, why not just go camp on the index, and observe the list
                                    of links to the side when you refresh?

                                    If I want an outcome to be less guessable then I distribute the
                                    foreshadowed data more carefully and cryptically. Practically nobody
                                    ever guesses stuff I seriously don&#39;t want them to guess. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Other times I leave more obvious bread crumbs to let certain outcomes be
                                    more guessable to the public. With the whole Kanpire thing I think I
                                    was pretty much beating people over the head with foreshadowed elements,
                                    including a brazen link to a SBaHJ comic in which Jeff appeared as a
                                    vampire directly below the scene of her demise. Hence her resurrection
                                    could safely be conducted to a chorus of NO SHIT!s with a few smug
                                    CALLED IT!s chiming in for backup, oh and also some HELL YEAH VAMPNAYA
                                    TIME!s working their way in there. This is not to say the outcome was a
                                    lock, because there is always the possibility for red herrings, and
                                    enough of those have been established so that you can never feel
                                    completely safe with a prediction. That is their primary value.
                                    Seriously, it isn&#39;t just messing with people. Making a story
                                    unpredictable has a lot to do with showing you are capable of doing
                                    practically anything at any time. Sometimes you bluff, and sometimes you
                                    play it straight. It&#39;s a little like a poker game. If you do too much
                                    of one or the other, people can read you easily. Even the silly self
                                    insert stuff has benefits in this regard. Predicting what&#39;s to come in
                                    the story is no different from putting yourself in the head of the
                                    author. If the author paints a portrait of himself as kind of a loose
                                    canon, either through a volatile narrative, or in an absurdly literal
                                    way as I do with the AH nonsense, that will be the consequence. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Part of the fun of a story is its unpredictability, and this one has had
                                    plenty of it so far I think. Unpredictability is a significant basis
                                    for suspense, and I&#39;m sure has other benefits we could examine. But I
                                    think there is also enjoyment value in occasional predictability, or
                                    rather, guessability. Setting up some obvious clues, and running with
                                    them to their logical conclusion. It&#39;s like throwing the reader a bone,
                                    particularly those who may be prone to feeling a little overwhelmed by
                                    getting perpetually outfoxed by the narrative. Another example of that
                                    was Jade&#39;s penpal letter. I designed it so that the clues would scream
                                    GRANDPA GRANDPA GRANDPA, and of course that&#39;s what most people were
                                    guessing. And the guess was very much on the right track. But that
                                    doesn&#39;t mean it was safe from another twist. It was her grandson, which
                                    is an outcome still compatible with the original clues, in a way. And
                                    while managing to be surprising, and not particularly guessable. So in
                                    that sense I guess that development had the best of both worlds. Letting
                                    people pick up on some more obvious clues for a change, and still
                                    delivering a surprise.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How guessable something is also relates to how close to the event you
                                    get. Prior to Eridan&#39;s entrance into the room, and even during, the
                                    deaths were completely unguessable. After Feferi&#39;s death, Kanaya&#39;s
                                    becomes considerably more so, but still quite uncertain. After her
                                    death, all bets are off. Not only do all deaths thereafter become
                                    guessable, but in some cases, &quot;predictable&quot;. That&#39;s because it was the
                                    line between a series of shocking events, and the establishment of an
                                    actual story pattern. The new pattern serves a purpose, as a sort of
                                    announcement that the story is shifting gears, that we&#39;re drifting into
                                    these mock-survival horror, mock-crime drama segments, driven by
                                    suspense more than usual. The suspense has more authority because of all
                                    the collateral of unpredictability built up over time, as well as all
                                    the typical stuff that helps like long term characterization. But now
                                    that the pattern is out in the open, following through with more deaths
                                    no longer qualifies as unpredictability. Just the opposite, it would now
                                    be playing into expectations, which as I said, can be important too.
                                    This gear we&#39;ve switched to is the new normal, and any unpredictability
                                    to arise thereafter will necessarily be a departure from whatever
                                    current patterns would indicate.

                                    I didn&#39;t even really plan the ball dropping thing until shortly
                                    before New Year&#39;s. I just make anything fit with anything. They are
                                    often crimes of convenience which suggest premeditation. It is the way
                                    many aspects of the story are put together.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Dropping the ball New Year&#39;s-style wasn&#39;t really enough. I also wrung a callback to
                                    Jailbreak out of it, <br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    Wherein the huge pumpkin rolled off the tower and settled nearby a
                                    stump, which through MSPA lore has always been affiliated with suicide.
                                    This subject was pertinent to Jade and Jadesprite&#39;s conversation.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004391" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004391</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    The fellows in Jailbreak even had a goddang harpoon gun, just like Jade.
                                    But... I didn&#39;t get to work that in. Not every idea I have gets worked
                                    in, if you can believe it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And one final note, this whole thing neatly solved the problem of
                                    building up Jade&#39;s house. I had long wondered how I might handle that,
                                    with it&#39;s unusual design. I concluded the best way was to knock off the
                                    tower/ball part, and build up the blockier structure.

                                    All I can recommend is you let the whole story run its course
                                    before you find it guilty of making any sort of anti-gay statement.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I mean I&#39;m not the tiniest bit anti-gay personally but I won&#39;t expect
                                    that assurance to pass for outright dismissal of those concerns. So
                                    really, just wait it out.

                                    So I guess it&#39;s a spurt? <br>

                                    Some people regard the zodiac realignment as having stunning implications for the HS
                                    universe. It does not.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The 13th sign has always existed in more obscure interpretations of
                                    astrology, and I have always known about it. The diehard HS theorists
                                    have been wise to its existence since the trolls were first connected to
                                    the zodiac.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This means the 13th sign has always had the potential to emerge in the
                                    story in some way. It either will or it won&#39;t. That hasn&#39;t changed at
                                    all with recent news.

                                    This scene was essential. It brought closure to Rufio&#39;s arc, who
                                    was clearly the third most important character in Homestuck. He died a
                                    tragic figure, and the final embrace between us pushed all the right
                                    literary buttons. I hope you aspiring storytellers are taking notes.

                                    Some people love it, and some people hate it. I wonder what conclusion I should draw
                                    from this schism in reception?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How about:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    pf?f?f?f?f?f?f?f<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I view them as little opportunities to do funny things, sometimes
                                    serving as transitions both in mood and story direction, and yet another
                                    device with which to keep things light and ridiculous in a story which I
                                    refuse to drag all the way on to serious turf, even if I threaten to at
                                    times.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You could view me as a sort of &quot;host&quot; of the story, touching on recent
                                    themes in silly ways. Sometimes story&#39;s have such players - in the
                                    story, but not actually a part of it. If I were to influence the story
                                    events directly, that would be a different type of self insert approach,
                                    and one I have no interest in. If I have any impact on the story at
                                    all, it will be through an explicitly unobtrusive mechanism. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have no problem saying so, because that&#39;s not actually a point of suspense I care
                                    about.

                                    No, but I have to wonder about it simply because some
                                    non-caucasian races have pretty big lips too, like black people, and
                                    it&#39;s considered kind of inappropriate to talk about.<br>

                                    So whenever anyone brings it up, in addition to presuming jealousy on their part,
                                    I&#39;m inclined to think, &quot;you fucking racist.&quot;

                                    No way. That movie didn&#39;t invent time travel complexity nor is
                                    it really close to being the most compelling implementation of those
                                    concepts. It was a pretty decent movie, but the only thing it actually
                                    influenced were those time trails in the Felt arc.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Complex time travel stuff is something I&#39;ve always thought about.
                                    Actually, about ten years ago around the time when that movie came out,
                                    my friend Jan and I (who I did the Star Trek edits with) worked for a
                                    while on a screenplay for what we were slating to be the most maniacal
                                    and complicated time travel movie ever. It was called Copy/Paste. We
                                    were essentially working on Primer I guess, a few years before Primer
                                    came out. It was pretty close to being done, but I guess we lost
                                    interest. Then later Primer came out, and we didn&#39;t need to bother with
                                    that anymore. Then 5 years after that I started Homestuck, thus
                                    rendering Primer obsolete, in a flourish of silly jokes. (????) (YOU
                                    DECIDE.)

                                    adorable as possible.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But having said that I bet you wouldn&#39;t feel that confident guessing what her fate
                                    will be, would you? Probably not.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If I have not portrayed myself as perfectly capable of making Nepeta the
                                    sole survivor of this comic, then I probably fucked up somewhere along
                                    the way.

                                    I&#39;m not even sure I do compared to a lot of other well known internet creators, but
                                    it doesn&#39;t matter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Feelings-wise, I&#39;m pretty much unflappable. You might as well register
                                    your grievance with a brick wall. And in some cases, negative opinions
                                    only fuel in-story &quot;rebukes&quot;, but that has more to do with mischief on
                                    my part than actual retaliation. And I am prone to finding that funny,
                                    whereas OBVIOUSLY the critic will not, and will be inclined to register
                                    additional meaningless grievances. It&#39;s all good.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A statement that I think encapsulates my attitude is, all things being
                                    equal, which they aren&#39;t, why is this guy&#39;s opinion better than mine? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    First of all, the situation is very, very far from being equal. I don&#39;t
                                    think much hubris is required to believe that ME vs. RANDOM INTERNET GUY
                                    is not close to a fair fight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Second, even if the metrics tracking quality thought broke even between
                                    us, it is merely opinion vs. opinion. I&#39;ll side with mine, thanks.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Opinions aren&#39;t even real things. They are ghosts made of thought. But
                                    lots of people on the internet, especially grumpy ones, treat theirs as
                                    absolute reality. Which can be pretty funny to watch. Or terrible. Re:
                                    youtube comments.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you&#39;re a creative type who struggles with how others receive your
                                    work, I might suggest embracing the attitude above. But before you go
                                    too far with it, you also might want to try real hard to be good at
                                    something first.

                                    arc as an utterly useless, whimsical stoner character, and all the
                                    goofy fan stuff made about him, and knowing about the turn months ago
                                    while people had no clue, and the reasons go on.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just think a wide range of stuff is funny. If you say I lump too much
                                    under humor, it really only means we don&#39;t share the same sense of

                                    I think it can be pretty interesting how a single line in a
                                    story, even one that&#39;s seven words, can dramatically alter the the
                                    perception of everything that just happened.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this case, I think presented on the heels of the deaths, it created a
                                    weird blend of sudden fear, as well as a contradictory emotion of hope,
                                    that MAYBE we haven&#39;t seen the last of one of these characters, even if
                                    the implications are ominous.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There have been a couple others sprinkled about HS. I think tvtropes
                                    calls them WHAM LINES or KAPOW STATEMENTS or whatever. (i am not even
                                    busting on the tropes here, that&#39;s a pretty legit thing to diagnose)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But really, I mainly like that page because of the text highlighting
                                    slow-roll. It was a fun preexisting mechanism to employ for suspense.

                                    It doesn&#39;t bother me, but it&#39;s definitely a real phenomenon, and
                                    one I anticipated a long time ago when considering the possibility of a
                                    growing readership.<br>

                                    I believe there are a lot of people who hopped aboard during Hivebent or
                                    later, and didn&#39;t really cut their teeth on the &quot;MSPA culture&quot; from
                                    which all that emerged.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    On the other hand, I know many of those people have been savvy enough to
                                    pick up on it, read earlier stories, do a little homework, and start to
                                    figure out why everything is the way it is.

                                    Why the death scene honks? Because this story has always dealt in That
                                    Kind Of Thing. Sometimes a sad moment is played totally straight (like
                                    Jade&#39;s letter to John). Sometimes, or often, a sad or violent moment
                                    will be accented with humor, if not played humorously straightup. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The bottom line is, if you have to ask, I honestly can&#39;t imagine that you understand
                                    much about MSPA.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And if nothing else at all, I guess you could just read this article.<br>

                                    I gave them all troll handles well before they ever came close
                                    to being real characters, but those names always set up the parameters
                                    for where I could drive the characters thematically when continuing to
                                    develop them, if inclined. So yeah, this was always a strong
                                    possibility, without necessarily being 100% committed to it the whole
                                    time. Regardless, there was some groundwork set up for that possibility
                                    should I decide to run with it, which I did, and the decision was made
                                    quite some time ago.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Same with others we&#39;ve seen recently. Kanaya had the theme of virginity
                                    due to her sign, which when you think about it, is a pretty TOUGH
                                    CONCEPT to shape into coherence for a character in an ensemble like
                                    this, but I worked it by bonding her to matriarchal themes with her
                                    virgin mother grub lusus, and the role she inherited as progenitor and
                                    caretaker of the matriorb, and more specifically, recently showing the
                                    futility of that role, as the concept of chastity is not particularly
                                    compatible with successful breeding. When she found the key to release
                                    it, it was a sign that all along it was not meant to be used, but
                                    destroyed.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eridan was originally cast as someone dangerous and genocidal, but those
                                    qualities were never illustrated and became easily dismissed as a joke
                                    as his whole character seemed to revolve around failed romantic
                                    aspirations for so long. But they came back, reminding us they were
                                    driving forces behind his profile. (His name, caligulasAquarium, was
                                    also tied to his various romantic obsessions, particularly the need for a
                                    rival, which is bound to the caliginous quadrant, another word for
                                    dark.) Ultimately his dreams of genocide were realized by being the one
                                    to destroy the orb, which appeared to always be his intent for &quot;helping
                                    her&quot; with it, making his preceding conversation with Kanaya much more
                                    detestably villainous than it seemed. In doing so, he destroyed hope for
                                    the species. This is his final interpretation of his role as the Prince
                                    of Hope. Not as one who fights for hope, but destroys it. He&#39;s
                                    certainly the worst kind of bastard this story has to offer.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Both Eridan&#39;s and Gamzee&#39;s dangerous sides were heavily masked by the
                                    long adherence to their roles as one note gag characters, and made it
                                    very difficult to predict these outcomes seriously. A few days ago,
                                    nobody at all is guessing Eridan walks into a room and kills two
                                    characters. And before this page:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005119</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even fewer people would ever make a serious guess Gamzee would become a threat.
                                    Commitment to the gag was too air tight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But that&#39;s was makes the development equal parts disturbing and funny in my view.

                                    I&#39;m not going to pretend I didn&#39;t think it was a very sad event.
                                    Feferi was one thing, as a pretty tangential character. But Kanaya was
                                    the one that hurt.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sad things happen in stories. Even funny ones!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Probably the most memorable episode of Futurama for me was the one where
                                    his dog waits for him on the street corner for years, until it dies.
                                    And then? THE END.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That was awful! I don&#39;t know anyone who ever watched that episode who
                                    wasn&#39;t emotionally crushed by that ending. Almost to the point where it
                                    was unbelievable they made such a thing happen. I was not alone in
                                    speaking to the TV: &quot;Futurama, what are you doing to me? FUTURAMA???
                                    You&#39;re not supposed to do this, you&#39;re FUNNY!!!&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And yet, that episode was great! Even the ending was great, all things
                                    considered. In retrospect its very gesture was sort of darkly hilarious.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not exactly comparing this character death with that moment, but
                                    just pointing it out as an example of a piece of entertainment which I
                                    believe successfully blended emotional tones. That&#39;s what&#39;s been going
                                    on with HS for quite some time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In fact, Futurama always struck me as a really good example of something
                                    that did that, and I can think of very few other examples. Futurama was
                                    perpetually hilarious, while doing a pretty great job of making you
                                    care about the characters and what happened to them. It actually
                                    successfully pulled off a lot of poignant moments, not just dog
                                    killings. I&#39;m trying to think of of other comparably humorous pieces of
                                    entertainment that worked a serious side well and not thinking of much.
                                    The Simpsons, not quite. Certainly nothing of Family Guy&#39;s ilk. (ok I&#39;m
                                    really just thinking of TV shows now) Arrested Development could be a
                                    good example. Certainly off the charts in hilarity and characterization,
                                    though in hindsight I don&#39;t think it ever laid the drama on all that
                                    thick. It usually played its serious notes to set up gags, and often
                                    shortchanged drama by making continuity itself a gag (NEXT TIME ON
                                    ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT: jokes jokes jokes)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If I had to grope for another example, I might reach back years and
                                    years to something called Red Dwarf. Which was a British scifi comedy tv
                                    show. But not the show, the book! The novelization of it was my first
                                    exposure to it, and when I was a teenager I remember thinking it was the
                                    funniest, greatest shit ever. It might have been my teen goggles
                                    tinting it though, I really don&#39;t know how it would hold up for me now. I
                                    didn&#39;t even know it was based on a show, and later when I saw it, I
                                    thought it was good, but not as great unsurprisingly. Oddly, the concept
                                    was essentially the same as Futurama. A guy is frozen in stasis for a
                                    long time, wakes up in the future. But he&#39;s the last guy alive, a la
                                    Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide. I always liked this way better than Hitchhiker&#39;s
                                    though for some reason, which I was never as gaga over as so many seem
                                    to be. This story struck me as not only funnier, but more heartfelt, and
                                    really captured the essence of the lonely journey of the last human
                                    alive, alone in a giant space ship with his idiot hologram friend.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thinking back on it, I&#39;m probably weirdly influenced by that series in ways I&#39;m
                                    probably not even aware of.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    END RAMBLE

                                    People tend to be pretty emotional creatures and I know that
                                    some people shed tears over much lesser turns in a story than this.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So knowing that, I guess there is something a little weird about pulling
                                    the trigger on an event which I know perfectly well will cause plenty
                                    of people to cry ACTUAL TEARS, most of which are probably perfectly nice
                                    teenage girls who I have no business affecting in this way at all. To
                                    those people I guess I&#39;ll have to offer a real apology, because I&#39;m not
                                    actually out to ruin anyone&#39;s day.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But when you&#39;re making a story with any sort of dramatic clout, even a
                                    largely humorous one, I don&#39;t think it pays to be gutless. Both in terms
                                    of reader reaction, fear of sparking sadness, anger, or bad reviews,
                                    and in terms of being overly precious with your characters and ideas, to
                                    the point where it becomes obvious you&#39;re unwilling to mess with
                                    anything or put anyone important in real danger, which does a lot to
                                    kill suspense. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But that&#39;s actually a pretty common way to construct a story, to the
                                    point where we are all extremely used to watching stuff where heroes
                                    are in no real peril, and because it&#39;s so common we can accept and enjoy
                                    it. This also makes it more shocking and emotional when a story steps
                                    outside of that comfort zone.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But it&#39;s only emotional if people are invested in those threatened. This
                                    is one reason why a lot of horror movies can be so ineffective, grisly
                                    moments notwithstanding. Rosters are knowingly introduced for the
                                    slaughter, with only lip service given to investment in characters. And
                                    even if approached skillfully, there isn&#39;t even much time to win the
                                    hearts and minds of the audience for the full cast.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But this is a little different. We&#39;ve spent a lot of time with these
                                    characters. And if the threat to their lives seems like a sudden
                                    direction, I&#39;d suggest that doing it earlier or more gradually wouldn&#39;t
                                    have allowed it to mean the same thing.

                                    The longer I do this the more I&#39;m struck by how radical the
                                    difference is between the experiences of reading something archivally
                                    vs. serially, both for the reader, and the author if he&#39;s prone to
                                    sampling reactions frequently as I do. For the reader especially, I
                                    think the experience of day to day reading is so dramatically different,
                                    they might as well be reading a different story altogether. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The main difference is the amount of space between events the reader
                                    has, which can be filled with massive amounts of speculation, analysis,
                                    predictions, and something I guess you could call &quot;opinion building&quot;,
                                    which can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side,
                                    these readers become more closely engaged with the material than
                                    archival readers can be, zeroing in on details and insights which might
                                    be overlooked otherwise. On the negative side, I think that excess
                                    mental noise the space between pages allows can potentially be a bit
                                    suffocating, and put a strain on the experience the material was
                                    intended to deliver.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The archival reader always has the luxury of moving on to the next page,
                                    regardless of how he reacts to certain events, and thus can be more
                                    impassive about it. That internal cacophony isn&#39;t given time to build,
                                    and if there are reservations about a string of events, whether due to
                                    shocking revelations, or questions over the narrative merit of
                                    something, or really any form of dissatisfaction, all he has to do is
                                    keep clicking to see how it all fits together, and can make a more
                                    complete judgment with hindsight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The recent pages had me particularly conscious of the nature of serial
                                    delivery. The whole scene was rolled out over the course of a weekend,
                                    first with Feferi, then Kanaya. When Fereri dies, this registers as one
                                    extremely dramatic event. Cue the waiting, speculating, worrying and all
                                    that. When Kanaya dies a day or so later, it registers as a second
                                    dramatic event! Again the scrutiny begins which the space allows. Is
                                    this all too much? How do I feel about this narrative turn? Is this
                                    setting a trend for a bloodbath? Does that serve any purpose? The reader
                                    projects into the future, does a little unwitting fanfiction writing in
                                    his head, and may not like what he sees! All this activity becomes the
                                    basis for opinion building, which is sort of the emergence of an
                                    official position on matters, good or bad, which is only able to
                                    flourish in the slow-motion intake of the story. That official position
                                    can be a very stubborn thing, especially when it&#39;s negative, and
                                    seriously textures the way additional developments are regarded. It&#39;s
                                    really hard to shake a reader off an entrenched position on a matter,
                                    even when it was formed with an incomplete picture.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Reading the same events in the archive is quite different. Very little
                                    of that inner monologue takes shape. And while the events are still
                                    shocking, and the reader may raise his eyebrows a mile high, he then
                                    simply lowers them and keeps reading. In fact, because of the reading
                                    pace, I would suggest these two deaths actually register as only ONE
                                    DRAMATIC EVENT! One guy snaps and kills two characters. In the flow of
                                    straight-through reading especially, it is quite startling,
                                    tension-building, and can only serve to propel the reader into further
                                    pages, at a pace which suspends the experience-compromising
                                    (augmenting??) play-by-play.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But like I&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t think one way of reading is necessarily
                                    better than the other. Both have plusses, and obviously I choose to make
                                    this serially, and I play off plenty of in the moment reactions. But I
                                    tend consider the archival experience more, because when all is said and
                                    done, this thing has to sit on a server for years to come, waiting for
                                    new people to find it.

                                    It would have been completely ridiculous to black out all the
                                    timelines for the trolls who were going to die. Readers would have a
                                    checklist in advance, and that would be boring. This reason itself is
                                    more than enough to excuse that minor technical oddity with the Trollian

                                    Yes, you are missing something very big, which is perspective.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This Flash page is an appropriate length for the purpose it served. The
                                    first Flash game involving the trolls was inordinately long, taking
                                    something like 30 minutes for a player to feel sure all possibilities
                                    have been exhausted. But its length provided a good way to demonstrate
                                    the format&#39;s capabilities.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It set a precedent for a game of that length, but not a trend. There&#39;s
                                    no reason to expect they should all be. These are just individual pages
                                    in a story after all, and my intent for the format was always to make
                                    the games about this length.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The battle at the end did mark the end of the game. There was nothing
                                    more to it, and I don&#39;t think it needed to be especially explicit about
                                    that. You could try mashing the spacebar during the battle or whatever,
                                    and observe it did nothing. The prompt at the end to restart tells you
                                    it&#39;s over. What else is there to suggest there&#39;s more? Aside from an
                                    expectation that since it feels like a fully functional game, it should
                                    behave like one rather than what is essentially a shallow simulation to
                                    hit a few story points.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But that&#39;s one of the pitfalls of mixing these types of media. While
                                    flipping through pages, you switch from your &quot;story reader&#39;s mind&quot; to
                                    your &quot;game player&#39;s mind&quot;, which expects different things. Having played
                                    many games, we grow to expect fully fleshed out, complete gaming
                                    experiences from whatever we play, even if not consciously. These little
                                    in-story fragments can leave us a little puzzled, because they are
                                    incomplete, and the instinctive game player in us finds that a little
                                    frustrating. But I view this as a good thing, and wouldn&#39;t seek to
                                    improve it. The clash between those two mindsets of media consumption
                                    demonstrates we&#39;re engaging with something unique. It&#39;s not an
                                    experience you have with other forms of entertainment.

                                    GG: when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it<br>

                                    <br>
                                    She complains about insomnia while young, just like Kanaya did. When
                                    Kanaya was put to sleep by Scratch, her insomnia ended, and she woke up.
                                    We also know Jade did not have trouble sleeping for very long. Vriska
                                    started putting her to sleep to test out her powers.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Match this up with some remarks by Kanaya:<br>

                                    rules, like in chess, though much more complex. It isn&#39;t necessarily all
                                    out war, except for what takes place on advanced stages of the
                                    battlefield. If the queen is in power, she leaves them alone. Killing
                                    them would be improper. If Jack is in power, he clearly has no problem
                                    with it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And there&#39;s potentially more to it than some kind of etiquette. Though
                                    the Derse dreamers are heroes, they still serve as emissaries to the
                                    dark gods, who presumably tend to be opposed to the goal of creation,
                                    like Derse. There always remains the possibility that the Derse dreamers
                                    will carry out the agenda of the gods without understanding what
                                    they&#39;re doing. To kill those kids before that would lack strategic
                                    foresight, something a queen has.

                                    The monitor can only look at the present. You can only try to
                                    appearify a frog and hope for the best. If the frog appears (bad), then
                                    that frog was free for the taking. If slime appears (good), then destiny

                                    I don&#39;t think it was a direct inspiration, but I&#39;m sure it crossed my mind at the
                                    time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is probably how most kinds of inspiration work. I hardly ever come
                                    up with an idea directly inspired something else (unless it&#39;s something I
                                    did, in which case I do it almost constantly.) But then after I have
                                    the idea, I may immediately think of something that&#39;s kind of similar
                                    from another work. I may then modify the idea to make it more
                                    reminiscent of that thing, if I feel like solidifying that particular
                                    reference. The Donnie Darko style past/future trails in the intermission
                                    might be a good example of that. Or, I may attempt to stifle
                                    similarities if the reference doesn&#39;t interest me.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The chocobo breeding thing always struck me as a really solid example of
                                    a side quest in a game. Pretty tedious, definitely optional, yet
                                    leading to major boons far beyond the normal scope of the game.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So in that sense, frog breeding was always supposed to be reminiscent of
                                    a fun side quest. And yet, it&#39;s still absolutely essential to
                                    completing the game&#39;s objective. So it&#39;s not technically a side quest at
                                    all. Only in spirit.

                                    This question would exist plentifully regardless of what animal
                                    was selected. Knowing this, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very interesting avenue
                                    of discussion right now. Are we to weigh the universe containment
                                    merits of frogs, vs. say, bears?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The definitive answer, as of now, is that any definitive answer would be pretty
                                    boring.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But there are nevertheless some reasons. And more important than the
                                    reasons for the decision is to notice how thematically entrenched frogs
                                    have been in the story for a very long time. All the mechanics of this,
                                    the genesis frog and the frog breeding stuff, was conceptualized well
                                    before the end of act 2. EOA2 was when we first saw the frog ruins,
                                    remember? An idol of the embodiment of a universe to be created,
                                    positioned where Skaia would be, surrounded by four towers representing
                                    the planets. There was no basis for speculation on why a frog stood in
                                    Skaia&#39;s place until now. This has probably been the slowest boiling
                                    mystery in the entire story. After a while, I think prolonged,
                                    relentless exposure to certain symbols and aspects of a myth start to
                                    wear down the need to justify why they exist. They exist simply because
                                    they exist, like the features of fables we&#39;ve all heard a thousand
                                    times. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And finally, in processing the &quot;why frogs&quot; matter, it does help to
                                    understand the mentality I have in coming up with all ideas for HS. The
                                    idea from the start was to come up with a very elaborate, fantastical
                                    and ridiculous creation myth. Some ideas are quite esoteric, some are
                                    quite passable for more conventional works of science fiction, and some
                                    are very silly. Most are a combination of these. Most of the time, the
                                    silly stuff is not so outrageously silly that it can&#39;t be workable in a
                                    serious way too when needed. That adequately describes the concept of a
                                    universe existing inside of a large frog bred and genetically engineered
                                    by children, I think.

                                    The Tower of Babel did come to mind. There are many symbolic
                                    aspects you could find in it, many relating to ascension. It also put to
                                    use the basic idea of house building, inspired by Sim games, by tying
                                    it to a more obvious goal, to reach the gates, and then reach Skaia.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Obviously it&#39;s pretty easy for players to &quot;cheat&quot; and invent means of
                                    flying to skip the arduous climb, but as with many things, there are
                                    still hidden reasons for why the building is necessary which haven&#39;t
                                    been revealed. And if nothing else, it does convey the way the game is
                                    &quot;supposed&quot; to be played under ordinary circumstances, with kids making
                                    these insane vertical journeys through their houses, followed by
                                    fantastical horizontal journeys through their lands. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also note that there are many, many ways in which the concepts if
                                    Homestuck were influenced by Problem Sleuth. The Cathedral of Syndetic
                                    Ascension was two huge towers meeting in the middle of the universe.
                                    Climbing the towers was a significant quest for the four heroes in PS.
                                    The consorts were always meant to parallel the silly members of the four
                                    kingdoms. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Another detail of interest: note that there was a volcano next to the cathedral
                                    which played a significant role in the story.

                                    A joke can be many things.<br>

                                    Sometimes a joke can even be an allusion to a whole bunch of jokes you will never
                                    get to read.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That joke is made even funnier by the fact that all of those
                                    hypothetical jokes are practically guaranteed to be really, really funny
                                    if they existed.

                                    They look similar because all the outfits look similar. They
                                    look similar to John&#39;s as well, though his is a bit simpler. The
                                    differences in the designs are small details. Like shape of hood,
                                    footwear, etc. <br>

                                    Metamorphosis is clearly a significant part of troll biology, and
                                    therefore ingrained in their mythology. They&#39;ve got cocoons everywhere,
                                    and are often likened to insects through biological terms. The wings
                                    have nothing (we know of) to do with troll adulthood. But have a lot to
                                    do with their perception of what ascension should be, which is the
                                    culmination of a pupation process. Which is why some may look to fairies
                                    as an ideal, or rule them out as fiction on account of the ideal they
                                    represent. Ascended trolls in this game are essentially magical fairies.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Humans do not have a good analog for this though, and enjoy no biological upgrades.

                                    around. Tavros perhaps squirmed at the bottom of the stairs some more.
                                    He and Vriska took a moment to make a couple of useless replies to a
                                    memo, on the page you cited.<br>

                                    She did have an extra life. She had a dream self all along. It
                                    just wasn&#39;t in a tower. It was sleeping in a crypt in the center of
                                    Derse, which essentially functioned as her Quest Cocoon.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    She is a special case with respect to having a dream self (like Sollux
                                    was, who had two), and also with respect to the god tier resurrection.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The same rules couldn&#39;t apply to her, since she&#39;s the only character
                                    who&#39;s been dead since long before beginning the game. She couldn&#39;t
                                    resurrect the usual way because she was already dead.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So she has a different set of rules to suit her unique circumstances. We
                                    were lead to believe she didn&#39;t have a dream self, because she was
                                    dead, and because she didn&#39;t have a tower. But she was in the crypt the
                                    whole time, on her sacrificial platform, looking pretty corpse-like. Was
                                    her dream self dead too? There&#39;s no need for a definitive answer. But
                                    it would be reasonable to view her slumber as a state of undead-like
                                    stasis, like a vampire in a crypt.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Her resurrection demanded that her dream self be killed on the platform.
                                    And so it waited there for the entire session until Jack destroyed
                                    Derse, and was consumed by fire. This woke her up, and restored her to
                                    life for the first time in years. Her robot exploded as her soul
                                    un-disembodied itself. She then attained the god tier as the Maid of
                                    Time.

                                    The old FS account, andrewhussie, has been discontinued, having
                                    collapsed under the weight of 1200+ unnavigable, unsearchable questions,
                                    most of which were silly and wildly &quot;off topic&quot;. (re: there was no
                                    topic.)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have saved all of those questions and will comb through them at some
                                    point to select the most interesting ones and display them elsewhere, in
                                    a manner that is easy to browse, an arrangement they did not enjoy in
                                    Formspring&#39;s ponderous and entirely nonexistent archival system.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will also try to keep things more OT with this account, and address
                                    stuff that people presumably give a shit about, and try to keep the
                                    nonsensical haggling to a minimum, as well as avoid bringing to light
                                    questions of no substance. All of that was done with a spirit of
                                    amusement, though some people surely disagreed with its humorous merit.
                                    They were probably right! What do I know.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You may now ask me a question. This account is like a new Chia Pet fresh
                                    out of the box, and you have the privilege of applying the disgusting
                                    coat of mud to the orange ceramic surface, getting grossed out, and
                                    regarding your purchase with a deep sense of remorse. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You may also liken the account to a new kit of Sea Monkeys you just purchased for
                                    some baffling reason. That&#39;s fine too.

                In the Homestuck Beta, you eschewed the anti-aliased art style you had used for the rest of the adventures, but when you started the Homestuck Stable Release, anti-aliasing was back. Was there any particular reason for either of these decisions?

            Because I didn't actually know what I was doing.<br>
    <br>
    I was either not aware of the low quality setting which displayed vectors as aliased, or I didn't think it looked that great. I don't remember. I was also not even remotely aware of how much easier it would be, as well as aesthetically preferable, to just import loads of GIF graphics and animate those in Flash.<br>
    <br>
    This speaks volumes about how all of HS has been approached. There I was, preparing to embark on something I knew would last at least a year, planning to do every page in an application I knew practically nothing about. Adjustments were made, as they have been the whole way through.<br>
    <br>
    Launching into HS has been like partaking in an extreme wilderness survival challenge. I parachuted into the middle of the jungle with no equipment except for Picasso's stupid blank-loaded pistol. The beta was me unloading all the useless rounds into an angry tiger on the first night.

            Thanks for saying that, and also about the formsprings too. And also for being grateful I don't do porn? You're welcome.<br>
    <br>
    This is still by and large the type of question I get, and even most of the "troll questions" tend to be playful and harmless.<br>
    <br>
    The picture I paint with some of my question selections is probably pretty different though. Why is that? A strange form of theater I guess. Probably some people think it is unsettling, but that's because it does too good a job at rendering a great pit of hostility beneath the surface. Such is the power of having complete control over the flow of information. This is the advantage the media enjoys, and which is why they can keep a lid on important and completely true conspiracies from being known.<br>
    <br>
    I was kind of wondering if I went too far in any of my recent answers. Feeling mildly concerned about this, I reread everything I wrote, and I am pleased to report in the light of a new day that I have been 1000% exonerated. My FS answers remain as lucid as ever - coherent, informative, humble, and at worst, transcendentally hilarious.<br>
    <br>
    And if anybody was wondering, the comparison of myself with Picasso below was in fact a strikingly successful attempt to place myself on the same level as one of the greatest and most acclaimed artists who ever lived, if not significantly higher. In no way was the comparison made simply because everyone has heard of him, to make a separate point. If that were the case, ideally I would have selected a very bad and unfamous artist to maintain a pleasing veneer of humility. This is the most important thing an artist should ever concern himself with, we all agree about that.

                Y'know, sometimes you could just say "yep, what i do isn't perfect". 'cause it's true. HS is GREAT, I love it. But not perfect. Your storytelling isn't immaculate, everyone isn't dumber than you, and you are not always funny. Especially not on this page.

            Well come on now I obviously agree. Unless this particular page is your first ever exposure to stuff I've said, you oughta know that.<br>
    <br>
    I've copped so many times in so many different ways to the imperfection of HS and its function as something basically exploratory. Trying things out, seeing what works and what doesn't and learning from it. And also sticking up for the decisions and process that created it, imperfect though they are.<br>
    <br>
    The problem is all that shit gets buried deep in Formspring and people forget, and it's not archived like a blog so it's hard to find again.<br>
    <br>
    I think your point is one of improved diplomacy more than anything else. As an ambassador for my work, especially in the FS format for whatever reason, I'm pretty off the rails.<br>
    <br>
    Whenever you're dealing with a serious artist, there is a decent chance you are dealing with someone who doesn't always care to be polished in diplomacy. I've heard that Picasso was kind of a dickhead. He probably didn't cut a whole lot of slack to someone who said, hey Pablo you stuck the eye in the wrong place, fuckass. He was a very important artist and had all these BIG IDEAS and the net result of it all was something great. Maybe his personal volatility was part of that package?<br>
    <br>
    At the same time, someone would be perfectly justified, then and now, to say, hey Pablo, that painting looks like shit. I mean, some of his paintings really seriously did look like shit. And he would be equally justified in calling them PLBs for not "getting" it, and he probably did. He probably had his own term for those sons of bitches. He would be justified in doing so because he knew that everything he did, even the shitty stuff, was part of something bigger, even if only in his warped mind.<br>
    <br>
    But that said, and everything said below, maybe this is all getting a bit distracting. That is, talking about myself and my views on my work and my views on the views of others. It is possibly getting JUST A LITTLE tedious, and maybe it's time to reel in the purpose of my Formspring exploits.<br>
    <br>
    I mentioned a lot of stuff was getting buried. Maybe answering 1000+ poorly archived questions is getting into ridiculous territory. Maybe it's time to delete all the questions, clean the slate, and start new with a modified focus.<br>
    <br>
    Whatever imperceptible benefit typing this is having, I'm sure as hell not DRAWING right now, that's for sure.

            At this point 90% of all FS questioners are some variety of troll or another. With no exaggeration.<br>

    If someone's trolling me insincerely with some irritable sounding nonsense, I *think* I usually know when that's going on. But sometimes I'll answer as if they were being totally serious to add a fresh new layer of bullshit to this stupid dance we're all doing together here.

            I can't, she is obviously in charge of the story now.<br>
    <br>
    Her ascension to Fairy Vriska strikes me as a pretty decent distillation of who she's always been as a character. Impish, ubiquitously meddlesome, and kind of annoying.<br>
    <br>
    You could say that a character's ascension to godhood is meant to be the full realization of who they are, and prepares them to function as a demigod in the universe they create. Vriska's true form is that of a pesky, murderous luck fairy, and has been the only one so far to exhibit the god-like influence made possible through realizing this potential.

    So ok my snarky stuff is all fun and games until I say something you disagree with?<br>
    <br>
    I'm not "pretending to be a huge tool." A lot of my responses include an edge because it is funny and entertaining and probably most people agree. I have stated this, hence there is no pretense. Would I behave that way in real life? No, because that would be sociopathic and deranged.<br>

    How dumb do you have to be to not get that? Oh I see you actually believe you are HOT ON THE TRAIL on blowing the lid off a REAL LIFE DOUCHE BAG. Quick, take a blurry photo of me before I scurry off into the woods!<br>
    <br>
    But it was already clear you are not the king of perspicacity because you are in full PLB lockdown mode. When given a series of reasonable and logical remarks at odds with your perception, you become stubborn and hostile. This is because it is painful when you discover you're on the wrong side of the truth, and the response is only natural.<br>

    I imagine it is an even worse feeling to discover you're on the wrong side of not stupid.

    It has always been the name of the attack, but not mentioned as such. Though it was mentioned somewhere in Hivebent, without being tied to the attack specifically.

    It complemented a pretty brief, mysterious dream sequence in a way that matched the scene's symbolically cryptic nature. Dreams in works of fiction often communicate their messages in such ways. Like the strange backwards-speak in the Twin Peaks dreams.<br>
    <br>
    We had ten short passages, presumably narrated by dream Serenity, calling back to this excerpt.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002697" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002697</a><br>
    <br>
    And then four short lines by fairybug Vriska, hijacking the blinkspeak to have her say.<br>
    <br>
    And that's it!<br>
    <br>
    Being genuinely aggravated by this is a nice way to discover how boring you are. Kind of like being aggravated by the trollspeak was.

            We don't really know what she is or isn't doing. All we know is she and WV are sharing a dream.<br>
    <br>
    Dream rules have never been that easy to pin down. We only know what we know about dreams and dream selves after facts have accumulated over a long period of time. WV's dream sequence doesn't seem to fit into the existing model, and we can't expect to figure out how it fits into everything right away, if it does at all.<br>
    <br>
    It does seem the sequence was more like a "normal" dream, full of symbols and foreshadowed peril. Vriska, for whatever reason, deliberately or otherwise, shared this normal dream, and was able to understand some things about its context, and the role WV is supposed to play. Perhaps her psychic acuity was a factor. Perhaps her godhood status was as well. All you can do is speculate.<br>
    <br>
    We do know that she is dreaming without a dream self, and without her dream self having been killed. She is her dream self, having resurrected to reach the god tier. We didn't know anything about how such a character would dream, but here's a glimpse at some evidence.

            Oh wait a couple people are still puzzling over this? Ok.<br>
    <br>
    Authenticating your drawing isn't a simple matter of taking a photo of someone posing like your character, and if the photo matches up with the drawing perfectly, then everything checks out.<br>
    <br>
    There are other things in play, such as<br>
    <br>
    1) Stylization<br>
    2) Dramatization of perspective, through devices such as lensing effects<br>
    <br>
    And the two are related. Dramatizing perspective contributes significantly to the parameters for stylization. And not understanding this leads to some dubious observations.<br>
    <br>
    For instance, let's look at this cat in a fish eye lens.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.instructables.com/image/FMW0YNUX9OEP2819DD/11-Super-Wide-Angle-Digital-Camera.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.instructables.com/image/FMW0YNUX9OEP2819DD/11-Super-Wide-Angle-Digital-Camera.jpg</a><br>
    <br>
    If you converted that to a line drawing without knowledge of the lens, suddenly hopy shit that paw is huuuuuge, and way stockier and more exaggerated than could be accounted for by foreshortening. You could explain this, and there would always be someone out there who wouldn't care. They'd say, no it's huge dude. Look at it, it's huge. That paw is huge, don't even start with me.<br>
    <br>
    My drawing isn't being fisheyed, but there's a similar principle in play. Perspective is accelerating in the space through which the arm extends. It's not super dramatic lensing, but its enough to offset expected foreshortening.<br>
    <br>
    Combine that with the anatomical stylization of the figure, which is on the lanky-limbed side to start with, and you get what's there. Don't think it looks cool? Whatever! Looks good to me, but then, I know the vantage from which it's meant to be parsed.<br>
    <br>
    It would be a shame if all art had to forfeit things like dynamism in perspective, anatomical stylization and things like that because people not familiar with these principles regard their yields as defective.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway now that all that's been explained to death I guess it kind of ruins the drawing? Kind of like an overexplained joke. But maybe we learned some stuff?<br>
    <br>
    The funny thing is, I think people with more knowledge on art ironically tend to be MORE permissive of certain deviations in approach, like off template anatomy or perspective, if pursued with otherwise keen fundamentals and an intelligent eye toward aesthetics. It's the people with less knowledge who pick and fuss over stuff that just isn't really the "big problem" they think it is, even though they think they're packing hella standards. They don't have the knowledge to fully contextualize what they're observing, and they can't properly articulate their reservations, so they often resort to exaggeration, and QUITE often carry a pretty sour demeanor about it!<br>
    <br>
    I call this Picky Little Bitch Syndrome.<br>
    <br>
    It's not just art. Every field has its PLBs. Movies, books webcomics...<br>
    <br>
    And calling a PLB on being a PLB only makes them grumpier, which only further cements the diagnosis. For instance, any grumpy response to what I've said here will serve as a convenient admission to PLBhood! TIA.

                I've been thoroughly enjoying the new album, and I love the album cover. But since it's been thoroughly bugging me, I wish to pull out the fact that JOHN'S ARM IS QUITE FUCKING LONG THERE. What is his arm, a giraffe?

            Notice how the hand is also about twice as big as the other hand. Quite the mutant hand!<br>
    <br>
    Or, it could just be that the arm is proceeding into the foreground, causing perspective to alter the relative dimensions. Add in a slight stylistic forcing of the perspective for a dash of dynamism, and there you go.<br>
    <br>
    Understanding some things about art goes a long way in having certain questions not occur to you in the first place. Like why horns are solid orange sometimes, or why sometimes characters don't have arms.<br>
    <br>
    Kind of like when I learned stuff about science, I finally stopped asking why I couldn't see atoms, even if I squinted real hard.

    There is an exact way that A5 is going to wrap up, and there's a lot of dangling stuff that needs to be wrapped up before it wraps up.<br>
    <br>
    A5 is just a huge, huge thing and there's no escaping that. It could be bigger than the entire Problem Sleuth adventure when all is said and done. It is the result of cracking open the ridiculous amount of potential accumulated through the first 4 acts, and cashing all those plot checks.<br>
    <br>
    But I'm feeling quite sure A6 won't be nearly as big.<br>
    <br>
    And A7 ideally will be shorter than A1.

                So I understand that you had to limit your sketch requests bc it took so long last time, but you are charging your fans $10 for a sketch of a sprite and your signature...did it even occur to you that if you're producing less you should charge less?

            Honestly I never even set the price, not now, or then.<br>
    <br>
    Jeffrey at topatoco did, as he does for the shirts and really all the products. I just sort of shrug and go along with his decisions, and he shrugs back. This is how things go between the creators and topatoco often. It's quite an elegant ballet of mutual shrugging.<br>
    <br>
    But really, I think we should be clear on what a "personalization" is. It is a sketch, not a commission. A sketch is something I can do quickly, whereas a commission is not. I would love to be able to do every outlandish idea people have, and would certainly do so in smaller quantity. But when I get requests of an extremely diverse nature, often involving many characters at once, and have to do hundreds of those, that is actually somewhat mind destroying after a while. The consequence is a radical reduction in quality of the sketches.<br>
    <br>
    What is better I think is to do what I am doing. Which is to draw a single character, do a better job with each sketch, in a way that allows me to satisfy many people without requiring the mental gymnastics of processing hundreds of endlessly specific ideas involving 2-20 characters at once. So it's not that the price didn't drop for a lesser service... it's that the original service was underpriced!!!

                Mr hussy, reading your webcomic has made me realize just how boring real life is. I dream about alchemising pointless junk just for entertainment. I wish to store my jacket in a card when not in use... how can i help make homestuck real life?

                It seems that whenever someone complains on Formspring about something you did in MSPA you always defend your decision and tell them they're being silly. This is understandable, but statistically you should have admitted to making a mistake at least ONCE!

                Homestuck is a hugely complicated work, temporally and, I believe, thematically. How do you remember and keep track of it all? Do you use a tool of some kind, like a journal or a series of post-its, or do you somehow do it all mentally?

                A while ago, you said that your art hadn't improved much during Homestuck because of the way the comic was made. Now that actual drawings are more common, has this changed? I notice that you've been doing more stylistic experimentation as time goes on.

    I have gotten worse, from a pure illustration standpoint.<br>
    <br>
    The cover to Volume 6 is an example of my more conventional illustrative style. Which is not to say the quality diminished. But that graphic took me significantly longer than it would have several years ago.<br>

    It's just not the saddle I'm used to anymore.<br>

                There seems to be a disturbing amount of people that are exciting over the idea of Jade and Jadesprite kissing in the next panel. You have a great and terrible power. Take care in it's use.

            This is the power of the visual callback.<br>
    <br>
    Some people scratch their heads over them and wonder what's the deal. This is not actually THE deal with them, but it demonstrates something they can accomplish.<br>
    <br>
    What has happened here is a secondary, hidden joke has been told in parallel with the events taking place. Because these frames are direct mods of earlier panels conveying a similar scene but a totally different situation, the reader, if alert, remembers exactly what should come next. Hence we have an "extra" joke in addition to all the obvious points of humor. You are caused to imagine these two are about to kiss, and that is funny and absurd.<br>
    <br>
    This cannot be accomplished nearly as directly without the visual callbacks. But this does not mean every time we see such a callback, there is a similar joke being cracked. It's not quite that simple or literal.<br>
    <br>
    But using them frequently is important for setting them up for use in situations like this. You can't really just pull one out of a hat without establishing the tendency to do so. The callbacks have been woven into the fabric of normalcy first, to the point where they hardly raise an eyebrow anymore, while still demanding your recognition when they happen.<br>
    <br>
    Having established them this way, there are other more subtle purposes they can serve as well. Not just jokes. Sometimes they illustrate contrast in situation. Like when Davesprite defended sleeping Dave, that panel was reused when future Dave stood over sleeping doomed Dave, contemplating whether to kill him. Pretty contrasting moments, and the callback invites such reflection.<br>
    <br>
    Same with the Jadesprite callback. It wasn't just the joke being communicated. It also echoed the first time it was used, when Dream Jade slapped Dream John trying to wake him. Now situation is somewhat reversed. Dream Jade (Jadesprite) is being slapped by Real Jade. That character's role in the scenario has transmuted from heroic to pathetic.<br>
    <br>
    None of this reads at all, or is put in the spotlight for consideration, without the callbacks.

    Yes, that is right. Several excerpts of dialogue, wherein one character quite frequently literally said "boo hoo hoo", actually caused people to weep.<br>
    <br>
    That is the true punchline of the moment. That tear rolling down your cheek. Cherish it.

            I actually seek them out. But not the fake ones. I usually know when some spotlight glutton is faking a gripe to steal an answer out of me.<br>
    <br>
    A gripe of any degree of legitimacy represents a challenge. The challenge is to crystallize the truth behind the defense, which is the same as the truth behind my original actions themselves, even if no defense is really needed. When someone is virtually flawless, like myself, leagues of the curmudgeonly and the inadequate do him a great service by presenting their straw men. It is through the methodical and public evisceration of these proud ersatz fellows and the humbling of their puppeteers that his infallibility shines through.<br>
    <br>
    The devil is really just a straw man presented to God through which He makes a show of His true supremacy. A foil of His own clever and surreptitious invention, because He is a Smug Piece of Shit.<br>
    <br>
    And now having said that, I will put my ear to the ground and listen for the pounding hooves of the retarded cavalry.

            I don't know if I agree they're all interesting though, because in order to be interesting, perhaps by definition (maybe my personal one), those characters need to be used often enough to draw out the interesting qualities.<br>
    <br>
    But I do think that any character introduced, even very marginal ones, should always hold the potential to become interesting. And ideally, that potential should be evident.

    <br>
    If LE, a time traveling demon, appears at the end of the universe, how does he get to the earlier parts of the universe where he was running a mob?<br>
    <br>
    If with the same beguiling smirk and flourish of the hand I say "AHH, WOULDN'T YOUUUUU LIKE TO KNOW???"<br>
    <br>
    Then I'm frankly kind of a tool.<br>
    <br>
    The time traveling demon did, IN FACT, travel through time. Cat's out of the bag!

                The Hussie updates upset some people simply because they don't think that the humor of the joke is great and seems to cross that self-indulgence line. That's the only reasoning I've seen, not anybody saying that meta-elements themselves are unwelcome.

            Not really, there are people who don't like it on principle. I know this because I have read their reservations. Not a HUGE amount, but they're out there.<br>
    <br>
    The objections you mention OTOH are trivial. It is 1) unfunny and 2) self indulgent? Ok! Again I marvel at my inability to craft jokes which are universally pleasing to the global population.<br>
    <br>
    Is it self indulgent? Well, here is what it is on its face. It is another vehicle through which I deliver jokes, in a body of work largely comprised of me delivering jokes. That delivery is happening, IMO, in a way that is immaculately in keeping with the original spirit of the work, though you may hold a different view. Please read further down for details.<br>
    <br>
    But... IS it self indulgent?<br>
    <br>
    Yes.<br>
    <br>
    Such was confessed up front in the series of 4th wall interludes. Humorously.<br>
    <br>

                When you do recaps you sometimes spoil things that have not been said in the comic. We did not know that Lord English time traveled to a specific point and directly controlled the Felt. It is not a big deal but you should not do that.

            Nah, it's fine the way it is. You say I could take a different approach because *some* people don't like something? Oh no! Who would have thought a certain quantity of people wouldn't like something! I've got to make sure that never happens, ever, I don't know what I was thinking.<br>
    <br>
    So ok, 4th wall stuff.<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes I catch people wrinkling their noses at the goofy 4th wall stuff. Now, I'll roll my eyes as much as the next guy at some really inappropriate 4th wall bending in places it doesn't belong. Probably the benchmark for where it feels appropriate and complements the story is something like Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Who doesn't find it charming and hilarious whenever he lowers his shades and sasses us through the silver screen, while Cameron kicks his dads car into a forest to the score of "BOW BOW..... chicka-chickaaaaaaaa"? Nobody is who. But taken beyond that, in works of more serious dramatic magnitude, or just really mishandled in some types of comedy, people start groaning.<br>
    <br>
    Some people are inclined to give these things more latitude. Others are more strict.<br>
    <br>
    But regardless of where you are on this spectrum, I kinda have to wonder how cement headed a guy has to be not to see that if ever there was a time such antics were permissible, it would be through this particular format, and this particular story. Remember what sort of thing you're reading? Seems like I've got to remind people sometimes.<br>
    <br>
    First of all, let's acknowledge that regardless of how immersed you are in whatever's going on, this is a story built almost entirely out of ridiculous gags. The preceding stories were too. PS warped the 4th wall in similar ways, and this is the tradition through which HS was conceived and delivered. It's light, it's loose, and above most other considerations, humor prevails.<br>
    <br>
    But there are even more important reasons than this. The entire nature of the story/format is one of blurriness between reader, player, author and character. It began with readers issuing commands to characters, and me the author parsing them, and the character responding with action to both parties. It is at all times a fluid dialogue taking place between these story entities. And at all times the author's presence is quite palpable, even without the actual AH avatar present. The narrator's voice is pretty unapologetically my own, and I think that's clear to the alert reader. He quips with the player and the character alike. But it goes even further than this. As the story progresses, these player/character roles become even more malleable. Characters in the story actually control OTHER characters, through the exact same text command vehicle which drives the whole narrative! The whole thing is utterly saturated with such meta qualities, and picking out the single generically unpalatable author avatar as the deal breaker in all this is pretty petty, and reeking of less than comprehensive appreciation for the themes. The story is about players and characters watching and controlling players and characters watching and controlling players and characters, in screens in screens in screens. Server player monitors client player. Exile commands session player. Trolls from one session mess with those from another. People are commanded psychically, through reader input, through the reader's keyboard arrows at times, through the narrative volition of ==&gt;, and through author mandate. People are spied on through crystal balls, fenestrated walls, Sburb windows, chat clients, future command station terminals, dreams, clouds, and finally, yes, a 4th wall through which we have access to the author, who's very presence in the story was already keenly felt REGARDLESS.<br>
    <br>
    All of this considered, even if you're of the mindset of "NEVER NEVER NEVER" on 4th wall shenanigans, it's still beyond me how you couldn't see that if one and only one story/format combo was to get a free pass on this, it would be HS. Everything written above is quite honestly approaching the threshold of the unassailable.<br>
    <br>
    But sticking to your guns on that stance is most definitely a safe position to take.<br>
    <br>
    Safe, and also WRONG.<br>
    <br>
    Safe and wrong. Wow, what a terrible combination!<br>
    <br>
    I have trouble imagining how ashamed I would feel if I ever lumbered under such a grueling dichotomy.

            Karkat has not taken his old role. That part of the question honestly makes no sense to me.<br>
    <br>
    But to answer the first part,<br>
    <br>
    Of course.<br>
    <br>
    Jack is now essentially omnipotent, still angry, and has very little to do anymore but fly around challenging worthy opponents to duels, and when he's out of those, simply kill people and destroy things.<br>
    <br>
    What defined him as a character, and really any character, was his interactions with others, mixed in with some devices of limitation. Like what was expressed through his rivalry with the black queen before killing her.<br>
    <br>
    What he has become is more of a force of nature villain. Like a terrible dragon that must be slain by the heroes. In such a story, you don't particularly expect much striking characterization from the dragon. And yet it remains a legitimate adversary to continue challenging the heroes and drive the story. His rise to omnipotence can be nothing other than corrosive to his former portrait as a character. And yet, he's still presumably the same guy, so those character qualities could resurface any time, if the circumstances permit.

                As long as you're setting yourself up for the challenge of assigning events to a timeline, what about the kids? How many hours has their session been running for?

            The kids already enjoyed some very maniacal timeline plotting in the early going. In a way, it was a form of orientation to the type of insanity that would follow. We had timestamps on their computers, pinning down exactly when certain conversations took place, even though at that point all these events were relatively mundane. But then it all loosened up significantly as each began entering their session.<br>
    <br>
    Timelining the troll events more strictly presents a more novel challenge. Doing so for the more recent kid events would be fairly trivial, and I doubt I'll bother.

                I am getting tired of the foreshadowed deaths. They don't make me sad. With them you get no Reader's Tears from me. If you want sadness do something sudden, although the forums may disagree with me.

    <div class="response-container">
        <p>
            If you believe the moments are designed to wring every drop from your emotional rag, you are mistaken, and are engaging with events on a pretty shallow level.<br>
    <br>
    These are not even foreshadowed events, per se. They have been explicitly forecast. Doomed Dave WAS going to die. Aradia WAS going to explode. We knew these things, and their patent inevitability should tip you off that these deaths were not meant to trigger what you seem to be looking for.<br>
    <br>
    There are many things we know in advance, and the intrigue surrounds discovering how, rather than if or what. And mixed in with this, there are many revelations not foretold as well. This seems to me to be the best way to assemble a story dealing heavily with not only time travel, but nonlinear construction.<br>
    <br>
    And if you care to adjust your dials to the actual emotional frequency of what is going on in a story, maybe you should consider this. Sometimes emotion is not conducted directly to the reader by a death, through a first hand sense of shock and loss, but peripherally through the other characters' reactions to that loss! Consider a biographical film of a famous person's story who is known to die tragically. Is there no room for emotion surrounding the inevitable?

            They are in the cache of concepts yet to materialize in the story. They will materialize when it is appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    HS has been riddled with concepts introduced, and then buried in hibernation for extremely long periods of time. Then when they finally resurface, they seem like they've been around forever!<br>
    <br>
    Like John's green package from Jade. The story played keepaway with the reader, dangling that box out there for a very long time. And now, it and its contents, the bunny, have functioned as an indispensable aspect of the plot for quite some time.

    It is also possible it has jumped your personal shark, while many other people's sharks remain happily unjumped.<br>

    Sometimes people mistake their personal sharks for the global shark. It doesn't sound like you're doing this though, which is pretty cool.<br>

    <br>
    If you have brown hair and brown eyes, dose that mean there is a lot of hair in your iris???<br>
    <br>
    Nope. It is because the eyes and hair are saturated with a common ingredient called melanin.<br>
    <br>
    Trolls' physiology is saturated with a similar ingredient, specific to their position on the hemospectrum. It heavily colors their blood, and tints their tears.

                Seeing as how Nepeta and Feferi are dreaming at Derse at the point of Aradia's explosion, doesn't that mean that Aradia's convo with Rose takes place AFTER this explosion? Feferi was dreaming of the Furthest Ring then + Eridan's compy wasn't intact.

            See notes a couple questions down.<br>
    <br>
    Pinning some of these key events to a concrete timestamped schedule has sort of opened a can of worms, which I deliberately springloaded into the can and fired into my own face. I guess I am inviting the challenge for myself to make all this hazy troll timetable stuff more definite?<br>
    <br>
    Before I could always decide that a troll could do something or talk to someone, and there would always be a built in fudge factor dictating when it actually happened. And that worked pretty well. I built up quite a lot of events and conversational itineraries that way. But now that it's all out there, I guess it's kind of a personal challenge to see if I can make a little more sense of it (without being excruciatingly rigorous that is).<br>
    <br>
    So now we have some key times on a countdown to zero, which we can place some critical events on.<br>
    <br>
    10:25:00 - Jack arrives in troll session. Trolls escape to veil, spend about 4 hours messing around doing who knows what.<br>
    <br>
    Minutes before time below: Tavros gets legs sawed off, Karkat faints.<br>
    <br>
    06:12:00 - Prospit is destroyed. Dream Karkat etc are killed.<br>
    <br>
    Shortly after that, Terezi smells explosion, goes downstairs, discovers money transfer from Dave. Thus learns about humans. She and other trolls (notably Vriska) get a head start on messing with kids while Karkat sleeps,<br>
    <br>
    05:12:30 - One hour later, exactly halfway through countdown, Karkat wakes up, learns about humans, begins campaign of trolling.<br>
    <br>
    04:13:00 - Jack destroys Derse. Eridan's computer and Aradia blow up. Feferi stays asleep while dream-dead, shares dream bubble with Jade. Later wakes up, talks to Jade about it.<br>
    <br>
    Knowing this basic structure, we can fill in a lot of events around this loosely, between and after the key points. For instance, at 4:13, it seems Vriska and Tavros have not left the room yet for their confrontation. Eridan has yet to get his wand. And so on.<br>
    <br>
    We also know that shortly after the expiration of the countdown, Terezi has the conversation with Dave in which she told him to wire the money back to her, 6 hours and 12 minutes ago from her vantage. This suggests she has not stayed completely linear in her interaction with Dave. (Which would make sense, considering how much time traveling he's been doing.)<br>
    <br>
    We also know that Karkat is around after the countdown from one of the memo timestamps.<br>
    <br>
    It's a big puzzle!

                Do you find writing Eridan and/or Jade pesterlogs harder than writing the rest? They always seem to come out later and be shorter than pesterlogs from the other characters.

            Always?? I didn't realize one could be so tapped into the update schedule surrounding these particular characters.<br>
    <br>
    In this case though, I had actually written the whole log, and had a file saving mishap. I then had to rewrite it all from memory, which took twice as long, because it was pretty tedious, and I was somehow convinced the original log was better.

            It isn't really that confusing. All you really need to know is there are three events which happen NEARLY simultaneously.<br>
    <br>
    1) Eridan's computer blows up (because of Rose).<br>
    2) Aradia blows up for reasons unknown.<br>
    3) Derse is destroyed by Jack, causing Feferi's bubble to go black, and Nepeta to wake up.<br>
    <br>
    Technically, 1) happens first. Shortly after, a bit less than a minute, 2) happens. 3) happens in a nebulous stretch of time over that duration. He destroys Derse presumably in a similar manner to how he destroyed Prospit. There is some degree of time lapse involved.<br>
    <br>
    But these are details. All you need to know is they all happened right around the same time.<br>
    <br>
    All of these key events were mentioned/shown in [S] Past Karkat: Wake up.

            Sollux macks twofold. We do not see his activity very often because it is TOO HOT FOR THE WEB.<br>
    <br>
    He doesn't do much in the story because he is a supporting character. He is the guy who stuff happens to, rather than a guy who does stuff. Until further notice.<br>
    <br>
    This again raises the issue of supporting characters vs. major characters. Sure he would be a stronger and more interesting character if he had the screen time to allow it. But we must imagine this SHADOW PLOT wherein he occupies this time and does interesting things, and all the existing pages and action which that must necessarily be crowded out in favor of developing him that way. Is it worth it? Maybe, if you are a huge Sollux fan. But in this dimension, that is not the role he plays in an otherwise very busy story, and that's just how it is.

            It's hard to communicate how inferior the term query hook is to surprise noodle. They are in completely different universes.<br>

    Query hook is not a term I would ever come up with, nor would I ever endorse it.<br>

    If the entire realm of interrogative remarks were World War II, surprise noodles would be the mighty Nazis, while query hooks would be the lowly Jews.

            I don't actually hate the animes, I just sort of shrug at them theatrically for hilarious purposes.<br>
    <br>
    The animes represent a wide body of entertainment which includes some good stuff, as well as an absolutely incomprehensible amount of shit. Like anything.<br>
    <br>
    Any smart guy could have concluded that's how I felt about it though, without me saying so. Drawing rigid conclusions from a pool of ambiguous, tongue in cheek remarks is foolish. Rigidity in perception is the hobgoblin of a shallow mind. This hobgoblin's visage is the portrait of inadequacy, and he casts his mischievous leer at you from the other side of the looking glass!<br>
    <br>
    And thus it was the animes taught you how to be a better person. Thank them kindly.

            My plan at the moment is to make Act 7 serve as pure wrap up. Perhaps consisting only of several significant animations.<br>

    If that is that case, then Act 6 would function as the last "normal" act.<br>

    The trolls had a long and eventful adventure. Karkat took Jack's regisword and used it to make a regisickle. We can infer that at some point they managed to duplicate and/or steal the queen's lance. The queen either kept her original copy of the lance, or stole it back, or it got sent to Alternia via the exiling process, just like the Queen did to become Snowman. At which point Snowman recovered it.<br>
    <br>
    There are so many possible ways to explain this.

                In the Image Manip thread, it was noticed that the scenes with gratuitous amounts of troll blood weren't all that disturbing until you turned the blood red, which is a normal response I suppose. Was this one of the reasons you gave them unrealistic blood?

    The hemospectrum was just an idea that grew quite organically, something that wasn't part of the picture at all until after Hivebent was underway . It turned out to be a pretty good detail to fuel some of the dilemmas and intrigue surrounding the trolls' story, as well as just something kind of fun and unique about their race. Hivebent was in part about fleshing out the details of the race and setting them apart from humans, in a fairly traditional sci-fi world building sense. All grounded in humor of course.

            I didn't intend to completely rip on it. It's a pretty entertaining site in some ways, and definitely in moderation.<br>
    <br>
    One of the worst things about it is not necessarily the site, but the influence it has on the way so many people discuss entertainment. Dropping trope names starts to become a substitute for original ideas and critical thinking. This also leads to flagrant misdiagnoses of what's going on in a story as some pretty bland minds struggle to shoehorn everything they see into a defined trope.<br>
    <br>
    It's like religion. Silly people forfeit original thought and substitute it for reference to excerpts in scripture. TvTropes is the holy scripture for anime nerds, and less caustically, just a bunch of young people who don't really know any better yet.

    <br>
    Thief of Light means she can take luck from others. This makes her lucky.<br>
    <br>
    Seer of Light would better translate to "understander of fortune". Whatever that means!<br>
    <br>
    But we should note that it's pretty questionable how well Rose has been keeping up with her personal quest duties.

                If a player is killed, does the dreamself always replace them, or does the dreamself die as well if they are not quickly resurrected through some special method? Like how Dream John started bleeding from a stab wound and Dream Vriska started bleeding out?
            </a>

    <div class="response-container">
        <p>
            There are only two ways we know of that the dream self can serve as an extra life.<br>
    <br>
    1) The corpse must be kissed by a prince or princess. (Please note, they are technically all princes/princesses of their respective moons.)<br>
    <br>
    2) The player must die on their quest bed/cocoon, in which case their dream self takes over while upgrading to god tier on the battlefield.<br>
    <br>
    The dream self also takes on the critical wounds sustained by the real self, but in a delayed fashion. Note how dream John began bleeding a little while after he was stabbed. These wounds are healed upon resurrection.<br>
    <br>
    Presumably the dream self will eventually die from the same wounds inflicted on the real self, but after a time delay. This would suggest the player has a pretty brief time limit to complete their resurrection.<br>
    <br>
    We've only seen three examples of this. John and Vriska, who both died on the quest bed/cocoon, so the time limit didn't matter.<br>
    <br>
    Sollux was also resurrected after being kissed by Feferi. This means after he died, she made the trip between her world and his in QUITE A HURRY.

            We've only been printing around 100 of each design when stocking shirts. More than that would require a significant setup and staff to ship out in a timely fashion, beyond what I have now which is just my friend Cindy shipping them out herself.<br>
    <br>
    Next year hopefully I will be able to put things in place to satisfy demand. Having to dealing with significant demand for this stuff caught me a bit off guard, because until quite recently, it wasn't really like that. Also, what modest sales there were, Topatoco handled for me, and I never had to think about it.

            Yeah but a story doesn't have to be just one thing. What's so hard to understand about that?<br>
    <br>
    There have been other heavy moments. Bro died, dream Jade died, etc. Neither those moments, nor this one, nullifies the thousands of absurd jokes already littering this story, and those still to come.<br>
    <br>
    This little segment was a bit of a Hivebent throwback. (If you can really "throw back" to something that happened over the summer.) Hivebent was still pretty silly, but it was darker and a bit more psychologically charged than typical HS action. This sequence taps into the Hivebent melodrama again, and steps it up a bit, since of course the story is moving forward and raising the stakes, as it should be.<br>
    <br>
    And all that aside, there's still some humor present here if you take a step back. Understanding the full context, we see that some pretty silly cartoon mobsters from the future are simultaneously urging a confused boy to kiss/kill a girl. Believe it or not, that's actually a pretty humorous scenario!<br>
    <br>
    But that said, I'm not going to pretend this whole thing isn't completely fucked up. Of course it is. That's the point.

                Homestuck started out pretty lighthearted! I suppose it would be dumb to ask if you intended for it to get darker later on, but is the level of darkness about what you envisioned? Was Cal originally the only intended survivor at this point in the story?

                During the latest animation, Dream!John begins bleeding from the same wound inflicted on Real!John. Since it looks like the fireflies are reviving John (like the kiss to Sollux and whatnot), does the wound represent the two Johns switching places?

            Speculation abounds.<br>
    <br>
    All we know are the facts of what we saw.<br>
    <br>
    John was stabbed; killed.<br>
    <br>
    Shortly after, his dream self began bleeding from the same wound.<br>
    <br>
    And then, this became irrelevant, as his resurrection completed itself.<br>
    <br>
    We don't actually know why. Often we have a reasonable amount of information to make inferences regarding things that go by silently in animations. But other times, new mysteries are presented in animations. This is not a case where we "should" know why this is happening, if only we could identify the pieces which explain it. It is unexplained phenomena.<br>
    <br>
    We'll have to wait and see.

    Here's the thing on that. Ordinarily author inserts are embarrassing glorifications of themselves. But with Dave, I had to take a little something off. Because in reality, aside from the fact that I don't wear shades, I am considerably cooler than Dave. This is a fact of the truest proportions. Consider that all of his remarkable achievements (SBaHJ) are in actuality my own, while the scope of my real life credentials eclipse his considerably (time travel notwithstanding).<br>

                Given the nature of Homestuck, do you have any regrets regarding the characters, plot, etc? Maybe looked back at something you did a year ago and gone "ah, crap, I wish I'd done that differently"? Not that I'm saying you should -- everything's real cool

        <p>
            While simultaneously realizing that everything I do can always be better in every single way, regrets and rear view gazing are excluded from the process deliberately. This is storytelling in hyperspace. Everything is done with the intent to make something as good as it can be, as loose as can be, and as FAST. FAST. FAST. as possible. Lamenting decisions is at odds with this approach, and would be irrational. If I allowed room for second guessing, then I'd be doing something completely different.<br>
    <br>
    You can isolate any single thing from this, written or drawn, and conclude that with a little more time, some more drafting, editing and revision, it would improve. Such are the benefits that more conventional productions enjoy. They are how works of entertainment become polished. But that's not the mission here. There is virtually no editing going on here at all, at any stage, from conception, to typing, to drawing, to animating, to posting. The most written editing I'll do is tweaking a phrase or two after copy-pasting the text from the doc into the browser while updating. Drawings are never drafted or revised. It's always done in one shot. I don't storyboard the animations, and often don't really have the full scene sequence in mind until I'm nearly done. It's very fluid. It's all part of the challenge this represents to me in totality, and an aspect of its experimental nature.<br>
    <br>
    Could it reach another level with a more intensive editing process (or one at all)? Of course. With enough concentrated reexamination, I'm sure the thing could be smoothed to such a seamless literary state, it could enter Earth's atmosphere without catching fire. It could certainly be more illustratively maniacal too. But editing is a time sink. Even a little is too much, because the top priority by far is speed. To bring as many ideas to coherent realization as quickly as possible. I get the most out of visuals with the least effort, and even though it doesn't look like I'm using all my artistic ability to make this, I do use my full experience as an artist to understand how best to optimize. Strong, simple shapes and silhouettes, dynamic composition, attention to color choice, minimal splashes of animation, all those things go a really long way for making striking visuals without requiring much effort.<br>
    <br>
    It just occurred to me recently that I haven't even reread the whole story in more than a year. (It's too long! Who has time for that.) There was a time in the early going, when it was a couple hundred pages, I'd reread it now and then to develop a feel for how it read, and help solidify my thoughts on the new project and develop ideas for where I wanted to push it in its fledgling state. But after rolling for a while, rereads became unnecessary. I maintain all relevant story data in a part of my mind which I'm sure has adapted itself to be completely useless for any other task besides keeping track of Homestuck. (Though I will say, mingling amidst community discussion does help keep some details fresh in the mind.) The only time I go back to an earlier page is to verify a particular phrasing or such, or to check out a panel as a drawing reference. Other than that, I'm not sure if I've reread more than 10 consecutive pages in a year. That would be rear view gazing.<br>
    <br>
    But having said that...<br>
    <br>
    Maybe I'll give it a full reread in the near future, just for the hell of it.

                so what exactly happened to john's real body? the fireflies took it, and he glowed and then... something. did he combine with his dream self, so now their the same body, but in skaia?

            We saw what happened to John's real body at the end. It's still lying there on the quest bed, bloody and dead. It is now a corpse forever. It did not combine with the dream self. The dream self is an independent entity which wakes up and walks around when the player goes to sleep, or in this case, dies on his quest bed.<br>
    <br>
    When that happens, you may notice the dream self also wakes up on a corresponding quest bed on the battlefield. With a little inference, we can gather that since players have duplicate quest beds on the battlefield, that this is likely how players are normally supposed to get to the battlefield, rather than crashing into it via moon.

                So, was that just like what happened with Sollux, where John died and used his dreamself as an extra life, or was that something new that we haven't seen before that Vriska will be insufferably smug and Fred Savagely face-punchable about now?

            It's both.<br>
    <br>
    John is using his dream self as an extra life, like Sollux did.<br>
    <br>
    But it's also something we haven't seen. He was not resurrected in the same manner. Sollux was kissed by a princess, and his dream self woke up and took over as the "real" him, with no additional benefits. John died on his quest bed, which clearly leads to a much more elaborate resurrection. His dream self is taking over, but now as the fully realized Heir of Breath.<br>
    <br>
    Vriska knew this would happen, and it's heavily implied she went through the same process. In fact, she practically stated it outright. We don't know the details yet.

                Are the terms "the Medium", "the Incipisphere", and "paradox space" interchangeable? If not, could you explain their relationship to each other, and other parts of Homestuck's cosmology?

            No. The Medium is the generous ring of space surrounding Skaia, and bound by the Veil. It's where the planets orbit. As it is in between these two things, it is literally the medium, as in the space in the middle.<br>
    <br>
    The Incipisphere is all of these, Skaia, Prospit, the Medium, the Veil, and Derse, stopping short of the Furthest Ring. It is in fact a bubble in the Furthest Ring.<br>
    <br>
    Paradox space is even broader. It encompasses everything, including the Furthest Ring, all Incipispheres ever, and all universes.

            The desynchronization of sound streaming on the timeline is one of the most terrible things about Flash and the programmers should feel ashamed of themselves. I always remedy this problem by making stuff late in the timeline happen just a little later than it's supposed to, by progressively wider margins. But hey maybe there's some better answer to this than I'm aware of.<br>

    Lol at everybody coming here to read answers about the story only to find me talking about lame Flash technical stuff.

                okay, did Dave's decision to NOT go back in time and stop DD create an alternate timeline that the kids now inhabit? I am just confused as to the temporal mechanics of this current scene. Or was it the other Dave going back in time and getting killed?

                If you were planning on introducing a masterful manipulator by Act 4, why didn't you start foreshadowing it then? The end of the troll arc was not soon enough to make Vriska being responsible for everything not look like a major retcon.

            Retcon? You're getting carried away.<br>
    <br>
    Recent events have revealed her to be responsible for exactly two more things than we were previously aware of.<br>
    <br>
    Jade sleeping a lot.<br>
    <br>
    DD killing Dave.<br>
    <br>
    Let's look at the first one. We had a girl who fell asleep a lot, inexplicably. We had an evil troll who liked to put kids to sleep as her primary means of influence. HMMMMM.<br>
    <br>
    With Dave's death, her involvement was actually reasonably foreshadowed. We knew Vriska was responsible for killing Dave at least once, according to Karkat, per her feud with Terezi. Now we know how. Could it have been foreshadowed MORE SO before Hivebent? Maybe... but how, and why? All we knew was DD went to Dave's place to get the journal, in the exact window of time it was on the toilet. How did he know it was there? Some mysterious "anonymous tip" I guess. Now we know the nature of that tip. I'm struggling to think of a way in which additional foreshadowing would have actually improved this event.<br>
    <br>
    Other than that, her being "behind everything" was a statement made by her, an exhibit of bravado. We have no evidence regarding what else she's influenced.<br>
    <br>
    But yeah, looking at those examples you're totally right. I'm just WAVING MY RETCON WAND AROUND, WEEEEEEE.<br>
    <br>
    Recasting in the light of new understandings is not always the equivalent of retconning.<br>
    <br>
    I should point out there isn't much dissatisfaction about this really. I've just been cherry picking a few questions which strike me as stupid.

            Back on the serial vs archival perception issue, here's something kinda funny to put it in perspective.<br>
    <br>
    In the grand scheme of things, Vriska did some stuff to the plot that got people hot and bothered, and filled hundreds of pages of forum threads with discussion about it. There was a time that happened, and many things were said and grievances were aired.<br>
    <br>
    It was called "Sunday".<br>
    <br>
    And then there was a lot of other shit that happened.

            Not really. If anyone's a "Parody Sue", which is already an entry in TV tropes, it would have been Jade in the early going. But even then, I don't think I'd really call her that. I think it's a little lame to be aware of tropes while writing a story and almost use them as a palette, or a checklist. Like, ok, I'm gonna do that and that and that! I just saw her as cute, silly character with lots of answers at that point in the story with SOME traces of satire directed at "Sue types", who eventually had the rug of all her advantages pulled out from under her and now has to go through a process of discovery like the others. Not every peg needs to be crammed into some trope hole, even if it seems vaguely apropos.<br>
    <br>
    Vriska, if anything, would be a further distortion of a Parody Sue, like an "Evil Parody Sue", and even then, in a kind of meta way. She lives her life as her own self-aggrandizing, wildly powerful self-insert character, always comes out on top, and never suffers consequences. She even sort of mocks her own intent on this on a meta level by "self-inserting" into the kids' story and influencing their events, as she said. And when I say "she mocks" I guess I mean "I mock". I'm usually pretty aware of a lot of tropes even though I've made nothing close to an exhaustive study of tvtropes.com, and I'm much more inclined to include tropes by warping them rather than deliberately decorating the story with a lot of straightup instances. Though obviously using them is often inevitable, since these are atomic storytelling building blocks we're talking about here.

            She isn't the main villain, nor do I really see her as much of a villain at all, conventionally speaking.<br>
    <br>
    She is a major character, with a series of striking strengths and weaknesses, whose every action appears to have antagonistic consequences.<br>
    <br>
    Doing things which oppose the goals of the protagonists I don't think automatically makes a character a villain. It makes them part of the ensemble, which in totality creates challenges for the heroes. The other trolls also made a point of antagonizing our heroes. Could they be regarded as villains? Where do you draw the line in a story between troublemakers and real villains?<br>
    <br>
    Jack Noir is a villain. That's pretty clear cut. Maybe one good way to define a main villain is whether stopping him will allow the heroes to overcome all their major obstacles. I don't think Vriska qualifies, by that definition.

            That's cool, thanks. I probably am getting a lot of "WHAT'S UP WITH VRISKA????" questions. I haven't even scrolled down to look, so I'll just answer this one in a general way.<br>
    <br>
    When examining The Case of Vriska Serket, it helps to zoom way out on the story for a moment. Rewind all the way back to act 4, when just a few trolls were lurking around, and behaving as little more than a nuisance.<br>
    <br>
    When I was about to launch into the Hivebent arc, I thought one cool opportunity that presented was to introduce a very major character out of nowhere, who we had literally no foreknowledge of other than one shot of a strange looking horn cropped off panel. The entire profile of this character was always meant to be "someone who is in some way involved with practically everything", and the scorpio sign seemed suited to this. This aspect of her profile was conveyed up front in her introduction, and hammered repeatedly with almost every scene she's been in. Hivebent was a good introduction to the ways in which she entangles herself nefariously with everything, and slowly but surely, this has been revealed to be the case in the main plotline. It was unclear before, and indeed unclear that this was even a question that needed to be answered, because she had not been introduced yet. And personally, I think there's something kind of exciting which that proposition injects into a story.<br>
    <br>
    Before Hivebent, most of the trolls were portrayed as incompetent at trolling. And when the roster was expanded, the question was begged: are any of these trolls any good at trolling? So part of her profile was also to serve as the ultimate troll. Karkat was an effective troll insofar as he was loud and angry and obnoxious, but that's about as far as it went. Vriska was designed to be a good troll in the purest sense of the word. She gets people legitimately riled up. Both in the story, and even more importantly, outside it. There is no other troll, or really even any other aspect of Homestuck, which generates more debate. This was intentional, and continues to be.<br>
    <br>
    Now if over time it begins to seem she's behind more and more of the negative plot developments, she could certainly start to be regarded by some as a one trick pony, from a plot-impact standpoint. But there's a lot to consider here. First of all, very simply, sometimes a story is going to have that "evil mastermind" character, who by definition is responsible for things to an extent far beyond what first appeared. This I think is a generalized enough concept to qualify as a basic story building block to adapt in creative ways, and is not so specific as to encroach on cliche territory. The mastermind is a sort of archetype, and she's revealed to be one such instantiation, with her own style and set of motives.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, everything she's done is just logical with respect to everything we know about her. She is presented with a room full of computers tapped into the session which unleashed their nemesis on them. She has 6 hours to do whatever she wants. Given everything she's done before, the thought that she wouldn't use her time to maximize her influence on that session in every way she can imagine, and every way which suits her megalomaniacal point of view, is pretty implausible. Of course she's going to secretively wreak havoc. We are just systematically discovering how she went about it. This was an ENORMOUS question begged by the Hivebent arc, considering her relevance there. Which was, now that we know about her, what was Vriska's role in the kids' session? This is a really striking point of curiosity, especially since we had never heard a peep out of her before Hivebent. It turns out, surprise surprise, that she had more influence than even the "main troll". The difference was, while he was very loud and stormed through the front gate (backwards), she kept a low profile and was more devious. And if we somehow discovered this WASN'T the case, it would actually strike me as a pretty bizarre development with no real meaning or purpose.<br>
    <br>
    And going back to the point about "zooming out of the story" for a moment, when judging these things it helps to examine the difference between reading this serially vs. archivally. These are extremely different ways to read a story, and radically affect your perception of developments. Reading all of act 5 might take a few hours, but doing so live takes months, along with which comes a lot of intense scrutiny and speculation. So while you're reading live and it turns out Vriska's responsible for more shenanigans, the reaction can easily turn into "oh here we go again with this", because you're absorbing it in slow motion. Her antics become sort of codified in the rolling serial myth of the story. Whereas reading in one shot, I think all this comes across as more of a reasonably paced revelation of exactly what's going on, in a way that makes sense and ties stuff together. If you just read the story starting today, you didn't even know who Vriska was until a few hours ago!<br>
    <br>
    In act 4, there was a lot of intrigue built up. And a secret question could have been asked. What if there was an unseen mastermind behind a lot of this? How did that happen, and why? And what if we find out all the answers in the next act, in ways we were never imagining? If you were to entertain such questions at the time, I think it makes for an exciting revelatory process. We are in the thick of that process now, albeit in slow motion.<br>
    <br>
    And this doesn't mean we should take her at her word when she says she's behind "everything". That's obviously how she would view it of course. But to take that literally would be to underestimate the complexity of what's going on. There's a lot happening, and really she's just another cog, even if it's a major one.<br>
    <br>
    She gets a lot of screen time because she's a major character now, and as I said, that was in fact built into her profile before I even drew her. If you're wondering why we camp on her when there are so many other nice trolls to dwell on, well, sorry. There are major characters, and there are minor ones. If you're waiting for me to fire up NEPETAQUEST 2011, don't hold your breath.

            It's implied he and Rose have discussed some of these topics before. Both of these characters have sort of "gotten away from us", as far as their visible narrative goes. Whereas with John and Jade, we have kept a pretty close eye on everything they have been up to since they were introduced.<br>
    <br>
    Between Dave entering his gate and when he went to sleep in the gold ruins, there is much unaccounted for. Same with Rose after destroying her gate. It only gets more out of hand for Dave when he time travels more, i.e. becomes future Dave with the red sleeves. He's obviously been through a lot, and there's no way we'll ever grasp the totality of his experience. It's safe to say he knows a lot more than black suit Dave, but unless something's explicitly stated in the story, we can only guess.

                You would think that Karkat would be the most willing to ally with the humans due to sharing their blood colour, rather than trolling them, since that was his basis for making a pact with Jack Noir. Is there a reason for his being so difficult?

            Sharing his blood is not by itself a way to win his favor, because of course he hates himself.<br>
    <br>
    He bonded over it with Jack because he liked Jack better than the kids, who he saw as the source of all his misfortune. He thinks Jack is a cool badass who goes around stabbing people (i.e. Karkat mostly). He became like a father figure to him, and mistreats him just as a true Alternian father figure should.

            They are all mine.<br>

    User input is extremely sparse these days. Troll names were the last instance. And they were the first instance in a long stretch of time before that.<br>
    <br>
    At one point, probably well over a year ago, I thought about using polls to determine some major plot developments. Like what Dave or Jade would prototype with. That vague idea was one reason I littered a lot of weird things around their houses (remember Dave's collection of dead shit???), not only as red herring material, but to leave it open to this democratic solution if I felt like going that way.<br>
    <br>
    I didn't though. It seemed like too much trouble, and such plot developments have a way of pushing themselves off into the distance. By the time they come around, it's just more natural to have already planned what should happen and act accordingly. The reward for that sort of gimmick is very limited.<br>
    <br>
    At one point I even considered making a fake poll for Jade's prototyping. It would have looked real, but I would have ignored the result and done what I did. But even that would have been too much trouble for little reward. It might have been kinda funny, but ultimately.......................................<br>

                So Sburb was a giantly advertized video game that tons of people played in our world. What about the trolls? Did anyone besides those twelve know about Sgrub? Or is it just them?

            Looks like it was just them. Aradia dug it up, and Sollux hacked it together with his codes. Doesn't seem like they shared it with anyone outside the group.<br>
    <br>
    Probably better that way. Trolls are a nasty race. If there were thousands or millions of players, probably most of them would have been successful. That is a lot of universes created and run by evil aliens.<br>
    <br>
    Humans by and large are wimps, so the vast majority of the other players failed, if not all. (This was hinted at by lack of solid documentation on gamefaqs, other than Rose's. ) In that sense, the global proliferation of the game was logical, to improve odds of some group being successful. This is how procreation works most of the time. Safety in numbers.

            Once again, we have reached an impasse. A crossroads, if you will, where YOUR ANIMES collide with MY STORY.<br>

    Here is the thing.<br>
    <br>
    MSPA is a body of work encompassing thousands of ideas.<br>
    <br>
    There are many thousands of animes, also encompassing thousands of ideas.<br>
    <br>
    There is bound to be some overlap.<br>
    <br>
    I also have supernatural powers when it comes to coincidences involving the animes. This should not be overlooked. I have a sort of anime communion. It is my gift.<br>

                I feel like the latest updates (DO THE WINDY THING) should be a flash. Even just a small one. Was there just not a song available for it?

            Not having a song available is never the reason for not doing a flash. There are always many on hand.<br>
    <br>
    I'd prefer to be careful about pushing the drama pedal too hard. The dramatics are still ebbing somewhat after Jade: Enter. Not every major development needs to be delivered that way. Static panels have often portrayed significant developments. Sometimes they do so more effectively in some ways. For one thing, they allow the written narrative to come along, jokes and all, whereas flashes are necessarily mute presentations.<br>
    <br>
    Also, I didn't feel like it.

                In Davesprite's home timeline, Terezi killed John (and presumably Jade), successfully preventing Bec's prototyping. So how was there a Bec Noir available to ransack the trolls' session, so that Terezi could be in a position to make those manipulations?

            Exactly. That's why the timeline in which she killed John was not the alpha timeline. Because it resulted in such a paradox. As such, everyone from that timeline was doomed. (Davesprite, future-dream Rose)<br>
    <br>
    However, paradoxically, those same doomed people from that timeline were critical to the events of the alpha timeline. The alpha timeline, and Bec Noir, could not have existed without that doomed timeline. In fact, the kids wouldn't have even been "born" without it.

            The only other obvious color choice would be their blood color.<br>

    But that's not possible, because it would have given away Karkat's blood color.<br>
    <br>
    So trolls all have boring gray eyes. While we have our boring red blood. Trolls get fancy variable blood colors. We get fancy variable eye colors. Each appears to be inclined to type with their fancy eye/blood color.

                I've heard tell that Bec Noir is meant to be the "anti-sepulchritude" Does that mean at one point, Problem Sleuth was of equal power? Kinda scary. It also makes me wonder just how powerful DMK was in comparison to, say, the troll's final Black King.

            Let's not get carried away with the Anti-Sepulchritude thing. That is not literally what it is.<br>

    Often, ideas are drawn from other ideas without requiring an explicit, canonical link drawn between them.<br>

    He has a sword, wings, is driven by a dreadful green energy, and is evil. The character transforming in question is Jack Noir, whose alter ego is Spades Slick, who was the non-canonical evil counterpart to Problem Sleuth. That's all there is to this.

                Bec was created way before the concept of a Lusus, but did Bec influence the idea of a Lusus? At all? In fact, when you drew that weird crab thing for Karkat's sprite, did you think it was his parent in a way?

            I don't recall to what extent Bec influenced the concept of a lusus. I'm pretty sure there wasn't the direct line of inspiration you might expect. But I am sure that as it was conceptualized, the similarity between the way trolls are raised and the way Jade was raised definitely occurred to me. This is something that has been touched upon a number of times. One of the many culture clashes in dialogue that have been made possible by learning about the trolls' world in detail.

            He was always meant to be a "chess guy", and that probably had more to do with his king hating than being a mayor. His interest in democracy was similarly rooted in this character trait, so it's probably more correct to say the mayor command was adapted to those circumstances, and then elaborated on. Included in this elaboration was the civic roles for all the exiles, leading to the nature of their back stories in the medium.

                Was the coloring, or, rather, lack of coloring, of the guardians of the children meant to connect them more strongly with the trolls' lusii? Further, will the guardians of the children all die, similar to how the lusii did?

            That cursor was revisited later when Jade was introduced.<br>
    <br>
    The current continuity is always compatible with the older continuities. But sometimes certain systems and patterns are suppressed or ignored for long stretches of time, for whatever reason. Usually to place the focus on other things. It stays that way until those old patterns are revisited. Like when it turned out that some of the trolls seemed to be responsible for the very early failed name entries for the kids.

            He didn't do anything. The transformation was automatic, as it was the first time it happened.<br>

    When I said "He ditched [them]," I wasn't being literal about a decision he was making. Spoken more technically, I meant "his body ditched them in a natural response to the mutation he was undergoing."<br>

    We've all seen powerful dudes evolve into different forms a thousand times. They aren't making choices about their transformations. Come on, we all know how this works.

            The entry items for the trolls is one of those topics that was left to the imagination, and it's likely this will always remain the case.<br>
    <br>
    Entry items as a whole were never supposed to be THAT significant as a game detail, but in looking back on the four items we've seen, there's a lot to talk about.<br>
    <br>
    Each one is symbolic in some sense of a departure. And each has things in common with some of the others.<br>
    <br>
    John's is the simplest, and rooted in the most obvious myth, which is taking a bite of an apple from the tree of knowledge. It makes sense for a number of reasons. It represents the most significant departure since it kicks off the whole game. It's also very easy to "solve". There's no puzzle element to it. They get progressively more complicated.<br>
    <br>
    Rose had to break a wine bottle on her house, just as ships are christened. And though not seemingly a part of the challenge at first, the trial involved losing the bottle and having to take a leap of faith to retrieve it, and well as rely on a friend (Jaspersprite) to help her complete the trial. This was required of Jade as well.<br>
    <br>
    Dave had to wait for an egg to hatch. The symbolism of the egg, like the apple, is pretty obvious. The challenge here was to do nothing, to have patience for several hours and wait for it to hatch. And though it seems like a simple challenge, it proved difficult for Dave, and would be a significant trial for one who was to become the Knight of Time.<br>
    <br>
    Jade had to destroy a Bec piñata. There's plenty that could be said about piñatas. You could even be as superficial as noting they're used during birthday parties, and opened to celebrate birth. But I think it's more interesting to study it from the vantage of the symbolism surrounding the destruction of effigies, and the implications this has for the Bec prototyping and Jack assuming his powers. Her challenge was to destroy it while blindfolded, and only by shooting it in the head. Several previous chat references had been made to this outcome, which was similarly foreshadowed by their strife dance together. The symbolism of killing her dangerous dog to enter (i.e. a step toward growing up) borrows notes from the Old Yeller story, but in this case, it's a dog that can't die (though nevertheless would assume a death-like state through prototyping). Also included in her challenge was taking a shot in the dark (much like Rose's leap of faith) and relying on her friend who redirected the bullet through his own head, the very friend she was attempting to slay in effigy.<br>
    <br>
    This is easily the most complicated of the entry puzzles, very thick with symbolic meaning, and is probably my favorite part of this animation.<br>
    <br>
    Also note all of the items are, in a way, edible. The boys have directly edible objects, apple and egg. The girls have objects which contain edible goods; the bottle and piñata contain wine and candy, and both needed to be broken. Dave's was actually a little of both, a food product, and a container for that product which needed to be broken (i.e. hatched). John and Jade's items both came suspended from a tree. Each item had significance to the player, if loosely. Jade's was obviously quite personal. Rose's related to her mother's drinking. Dave had been plagued by crows. John's is the only one which seemed generic, although there was a tree outside his window which seemed to be a fixture of his life. His wasn't especially personal since it was the simplest trial, and something most generically befitting of entry and mythological departure.<br>
    <br>
    Each trial can be summarized more simply:<br>
    <br>
    John: Loss of innocence.<br>
    Rose: Leap of faith, trust in a friend.<br>
    Dave: A lesson in patience.<br>
    Jade: Shot in the dark, killing a friend for its own good, and greater good.<br>
    <br>
    Also, and this was one of those unplanned things which I noticed:<br>
    <br>
    A - Apple<br>
    B - Bottle<br>
    C - Crow's egg<br>
    D - Dog piñata

            Even though we saw the result, I think there's still some element of mystery left as to why he prototyped himself.<br>

    Could he have diverted/destroyed the meteor without doing so? Probably.<br>

    The word "omnipotent" has been thrown around, but we don't know how literal this is or what the extent of his powers was. He could do some crazy things pre-prototyping, sure. But could he fire a huge green laser? We have no idea. It looked like his powers were passive, for the most part. Teleporting anywhere, and being able to teleport anything anywhere. It's reasonable to think he could have redirected it into the sun or such. Maybe he had a good reason for not doing this, and blowing it up instead?

            I didn't forget. He's sort of a special case, being the first guardian and all. When Aradia prototyped with the frog head, it also had a tail. I guess frogs are a special case too.<br>

    Usually I'm pretty religious with rules I set up. But occasionally judgments are made to bend the rules slightly in not especially plot significant ways, for stylistic considerations or whatever else. The only real problem with doing this is I'm left open to the ASPERGERS GOTCHA TRAP.

                So, from what I can gather, Jade: Enter confirms two things. 1. The Scratch can transport things. 2. The Scratch was caused by Bec's prototyping or, rather, Jack created the Scratch. Am I incorrect in any respect here?

            Neither of these things were verified to be true.<br>
    <br>
    1. We still don't know what the scratch does, other than being characterized generically as a rift in space-time, and the thing that causes the demon (Jack) to enter the troll session.<br>
    <br>
    2. The scratch was not caused by the prototyping. There are many facts which make this clear. In the future, John is wearing his blue outfit while talking to Karkat for the first time. This is just before the scratch, as indicated on the Trollian timeline.<br>
    <br>
    We know that the kids have around 24 hours between this future moment, and the start of the reckoning. Jade's entry was not too long after the start of the reckoning, perhaps several hours. It could be in the neighborhood of 20 hours after Jade's entry when the scratch happens. Until then, it appears Bec Noir will be skulking around the kids' session, until the scratch happens, which somehow unleashes him into the troll session.<br>
    <br>
    No word of God here. This is all in the story.<br>
    <br>
    What we saw in the animation was Jack fighting with bro and co, getting prototyped, and then a flash-forward to him entering the troll session. It was not a literal sequence of events.

                Aradia describes the instances we are now shown is Bec Noir as being the work of the Demon, Lord English. This seems to pretty clearly indicate Bec Noir is Lord English, and Spades Slick is beginning to look like him, is this just a parallel, or a sign?

    <br>
    She describes a demon, but never says anything directly connecting him to Lord English. Only offhand references to make you think that's who she's talking about. Such as calling the rift a "scratch", which brought the demon into the session, where Scratch is the name of the guy who's job it is to pave the way for LE. Sure seemed like she was talking about LE, didn't it? That was intended.<br>
    <br>
    The truth is, there's no evidence at all to suggest the trolls have ever even heard of LE. Aside from Scratch making reference to his "employer" when talking to Vriska. Didn't sound like she cared though.<br>
    <br>
    Additional trivia:<br>
    <br>
    Note that Aradia appears to be talking to Scratch on this page. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004505" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004505</a><br>

    She asks why he (we now know, Jack) is here. Scratch indicates it's none of his business.<br>

            I think we have enough context for you to be able to answer the question yourself.<br>
    <br>
    We know the black kingdom opposes the game objective, which is to create a universe. They are the opposing force to creation, and perhaps more generally speaking, existence. As features of a game, they are "programmed" to be that way. This should tell you a lot about Jack's basic nature, or any Derse agent. He was born to be a psychopath.<br>
    <br>
    Although Jack appears to be a special case, seeming to be the most foul tempered agent, probably more so than either the king or queen. He also has problems with authority in every session. This appears to be part of his programming, causing him to be the agitating influence in a session. If something goes wrong in any given session, there's a good chance he's what went wrong, and maybe this is by design.

            This animation (Jade:Enter.) certainly had some twists, but at the same time had some reasonably predicable outcomes.<br>
    <br>
    On the Bec prototyping: people have been theorizing about this for months. It was a popular theory for a long time, and one that picked up steam as evidence gathered for it. From a certain perspective, it was "obvious", and will especially seem so in retrospect, through rereading.<br>
    <br>
    But sometimes the most obvious thing is also going to be the most awesome thing, and there's just no way around that. And sometimes, ironically, the obvious thing happening can seem a bit shocking because of its obviousness.<br>
    <br>
    This outcome was planned for a good while, maybe for about a year actually. And since then, I've laid the groundwork of clues and story logic that points to it. But after a while, it became clear that it would be a very guessable scenario in terms of what could happen purely from the standpoint of stakes-raising. So as I got closer to the reveal, I dropped a lot of goofy red herrings and engaged in silly forms of misdirection, to the point where it became sort of a gag unto itself. So while many may have theorized this outcome, by the time we were on its precipice, we were up to our necks in so much bullshit, I don't think anyone could be 100% confident about it, even if they still maintained the hunch.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that Jack was the demon in the troll session was another "managed guessable". Lord English served as the red herring villain in that session to deter speculation to this effect. English was described as an indestructible demon. The trolls also described their adversary this way (though note, this is a perfectly understandable way to describe Jack in this form, especially since they didn't yet realize it was Jack). The obvious conclusion was that the trolls were dealing with English, and this is what most people guessed. In fact, this appears to have been sold so well, that some people have taken Bec Noir's entry into the troll session as proof positive that Jack = English!<br>
    <br>
    Which is not to say that he definitely isn't. But there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in this flash which constitutes proof that Jack is English. Lord English is an indestructible demon (who also wears a very large coat many sizes too big for Jack). Jack is also an indestructible demon. Nothing yet confirms they are the same demon.<br>
    <br>
    There are clues that point to Bec Noir as the trolls' adversary as well. In Alterniabound (Karkat: Wake up.) Karkat has a hunch he knows who the demon is, but doesn't want to jump to conclusions yet. He'd just seen the demon in a dream, which we just saw in the Flash. There he notices the resemblance to Jack Noir, which he hadn't noticed in the first encounter. Karkat tells Terezi that if he's right, they both get to tell each other "I told you so." What he means by that is, Terezi gets to say she was right all along about Jack being bad news. Karkat gets to say he was right about it being a bad idea to exile Jack (because at the time, it's quite understandable for Karkat to presume it was the same Jack he met, rather than one from a different session.)<br>
    <br>
    There were a few people out there who theorized both these things in tandem (Bec prototyping, Jack = demon). But that's what happens when you leave clues lying around. Someone out there will guess right. But if you don't leave the clues, developments have no plot foundation. The solution is to misdirect as well as you can, in a way that's entertaining. Red herrings abound.<br>
    <br>
    If you go back and reread everything, especially parts of the troll arc, and the troll/kid logs, you see tons of clues pointing to all this, and very careful language about the demon, what the kids did wrong, etc, to conceal what would eventually happen, while not contradicting it. But in totality, it all added up to this.

            He ditched the fancy hat and cat cheek tufts for practicality reasons. He wouldn't look much like Bec with his pointy ears shoved under the hat, and the much bigger dog cheeks just replaced the cat cheeks. The mutation is a bit of an overhaul, arguably due to the prototyping subject factoring in as an overwhelming influence.<br>
    <br>
    Since it was a design overhaul anyway, I ditched the tentacles, probably mainly because they're a pain to draw all the time. He's a little sleeker this way. And regardless, he could probably "conjure" them again if he wanted, being omnipotent and all. This spectacle likely involves green pyrotechnics, and heavy masking effects.

            I think all the best movies I've seen too many times. Like Back to the Future. It's like watching wallpaper now. Nothing registers. So they don't really spring to mind as BEST MOVIE EVERSSSS.<br>
    <br>
    The last two movies I saw in a theater were Scott Pilgrim, and before that, Inception. Both were good. I wish I could say great, because I really wanted them to be great. But weirdly, they both suffered from the same problem. I thought they both tried to jam too much stuff into too little time. Especially Inception. Like, times a thousand.<br>
    <br>
    Inception was perpetually educating you on the premise. It was literally doing this until it ended. It's too bad, because it was full of fantastic concepts. Would have made a good TV show, to spread all that out and give it the exploration it needed. Only if done well though. Like the new show Walking Dead, which is taking a very cinematic concept, and spreading it into a series so it can take its time with everything, and I think it's great so far.<br>
    <br>
    I love convoluted ideas, but they need the space to be sold properly. This is why HS is almost 3000 pages right now. But especially for movies I think, that breathing room is essential. You need to spend time with the characters and feel who they are. I remember NOTHING about the characters from Inception, except that I guess Leo Dicaprio was soldiering around in another film with a big cross on his back, and bags under his eyes. The dude sure is sportin' some anguish these days! His plight was mostly invisible to me, because I was focused on solving The Premise Riddle, and also maybe it just wasn't all that strong when it came down to it. The whole haunted by the dead wife thing. There was Ellen Page who played the role of some sort of prodigy who could make buildings fold over on themselves, and then became someone you didn't give a shit about for the rest of the movie. Because there was NO TIME to. We needed the investment time. You can't pull giving a shit out of thin air.<br>
    <br>
    Actually the best part of that movie was probably her whole building warping scene, with the suspenseful moment that followed where the dream crowd began catching wise to her presence, and then killed her. That's what the movie should have been, I think. Focusing more on the mind thriller aspect, playing up the Hitchcockian moments, instead of the dreadfully generic, watered down Matrix-style action scenes. When they started up with the James Bond style skis and snow mobile chase, I literally said out loud "are you serious?" The zero-threat NPC shoot-em-up action scenes were the worst part of the movie by far.<br>
    <br>
    And weirdly, I thought the action scenes in Pilgrim were the best parts by far!!! That really surprised me. The fight scenes were incredibly cool, and felt very cinematically original. The rest, as I said, felt like too much all at once. Felt rushed, crammed, a taaad gimmicky, and somehow squeezed the charm out of the story that was present in the books. In the books you got to spend time with the characters, and the pace was your reading leisure. It was fun. In the movie you blistered through the plot points while silly Zelda noises crept out of the woodwork to remind us all how much we all like old video games. I know it probably sounds insane for a story about battling 7 evil X's, but I would have axed at least a couple X's to spread it out. Yeah, it's heresy, but Scott Pilgrim isn't a religion, it's a story, and a story has to be delivered effectively in the medium given.<br>
    <br>
    I guess, though you wouldn't expect it, I have purist sensibilities when it comes to film. This is why I say I would so heavily slash HS, to the point of vandalization, in adapting it to film. Film needs SPACE and TIMING to be an effective experience. So I would adapt the story to accommodate the purest FILM EXPERIENCE. Please note that as HS now stands, it is accommodating what I regard as the purest INTERNET EXPERIENCE. Something of a media freeforall, heavily user-engaging and unpredictable. But I like traditional components in cinema that have already been charted thoroughly by great filmmakers. Look at the space and timing in the Coen brothers' movies. Lots of attention given to individual scenes, isolation of moment and atmosphere, examination of character. No Country for Old Men took a very off-beat story and presented it extremely well through those methods. David Lynch also did that well, though I guess his movies were just a bit too wacky for my tastes. They were still well made though. Which isn't to say you have to duplicate these filmmaking styles to be successful in my view. Nolan, who did Inception, also did The Prestige, which was fantastically executed. It did everything I was talking about the right way to deliver what Inception attempted to, a truly diabolical story (though still basically simpler). Prestige was an A+ to Inception's C.<br>
    <br>
    Look at that.<br>

                Are you bothered by how slowly you can progress HS? You can advance stories FAR faster than those with a set schedule, but you still probably wish you could go more swiftly. (Or should I say '.swf-ly'?!?!? No I should not say that...)

            Sometimes I'd prefer the story move along faster.<br>
    <br>
    It may seem like it updates a lot, and it does. But there's a difference between high content output and rapid story progression. Content output can consist of fleshing out details, silly gags, and characters shooting the breeze, which while advancing them as characters, doesn't always do a whole lot to advance the plot.<br>
    <br>
    Story progression tends to involve the most dirty work. It involves various conceptual upheavals, lots of new drawing, and care put into selling those developments dramatically, or in whatever other ways are important. Practically speaking, stuff can get bottlenecked behind those developments while we wait for the creator (me) to be ready to present them. The most obvious manifestation of this is with Flash animations. I can't do them at the drop of a hat (well, not always). Things get a little spread out while I prepare for such events, and some of that preparation is just psychological. There are stretches where I'd rather just relax and draw "normal" pages, and I use those periods to set the stage for more major impending developments, arranging the pieces and often accumulating new details as a side effect. There is a very practical ebb and flow to all this, and the consequence is a story that probably seems more drawn out than it needs to be at times.<br>
    <br>
    But that's fine, because part of the point is to make something that is fun to read, given any local slice of it you sample. The meandering journey was part of its makeup from the start, by design. As a vehicle of compelling story delivery, by no means was this ever supposed to be an efficient, well oiled machine.

            I don't think HS would work well as a novel. All the dialogue occurs through chatlogs, and something about printing chatlogs amidst novel prose doesn't sit that well with me. Maybe it could work, but offhand it sounds a little gimmicky. In its present form, I think it can get away without being regarded as gimmicky, and more of a media exploration, simply because its format is so hard to pin down. The exploration itself is inseparable from the format.<br>
    <br>
    As I've said, I do think it could make a pretty good movie though, if heavily revised. But the ideal format for translation would obviously be a game. Obvious to me, that is. And maybe now you as well.

    To be honest, I think "favorite things" are kind of dumb. They're sort of for little kids when you think about it, like a favorite color, or flavor of ice cream. Grown ups don't give a shit about that nonsense.<br>
    <br>
    Exceptions can be made for when the thing is so much vastly superior to everything else, comparisons are laughable. Like MSPA &gt; all websites on the internet.

            Homestuck's really just a warm-up for something else. Kind of like how Problem Sleuth was a warmup for Homestuck.<br>
    <br>
    There's not much of a chance of it becoming cemented as an opus, or casting a shadow from which I cannot escape. That outcome is up to me, and the degree of focus which I put into the next project.

    <br>
    Writing is easy.<br>
    <br>
    Drawing is hard.<br>

    I think if two people collaborate on making a comic, one writing, the other drawing, the writer should be forced to serve as the artist's butler to even the score.

                So is Homestuck an exploration about post-death consciousness as well as a creation myth? What with kernelsprites being prototyped with dead biological matter, as well as Vriska's resurrection via Dream Self, well... The death motif... IT KEEPS HAPPENING.

        <p>
            Oh hey you rephrased the question you just asked.<br>
    <br>
    It is an exploration of those things, like post death consciousness (or more commonly, the afterlife), but a lesser exploration. Elements serving as more of a backdrop for characterization, things the kids have to think about and deal with.<br>
    <br>
    Dream selves in Homestuck are sort of a lot of things at once. It embodies some degree of awakening myth. A "truer" self to get in touch with and realize by overcoming something. It is also in a way the afterlife, if the correct measures are taken. It also provides a deeper and more mystical mechanism for the classic extra life in a video game. It is a means for a player to glimpse greater purpose and destiny, as well as the future. And it is even more things than this, which have not yet been developed or revealed.<br>
    <br>
    Other post-death themes are explored but mean different things in different cases. The sprites have more to do with resurrection than a study of afterlife issues. It's application here centers around providing players with guides, elders before them who are wiser, or in various ways more knowledgeable. In a classic sense, a grandmother has such wisdom. Less conventionally, a battle hardened future self does as well. A loyal, long dead cat may as well, in the tradition of an animal totem. Death is what separates an elder from an ancestor. Extrapolating, the game provides a means for its players to tap ancestral wisdom for guidance. And though this may be the intent, obviously it can be exploited in a wide variety of ways.<br>
    <br>
    Resurrection as a theme on the microscopic level is in play with the sprites. Macroscopically, it's invoked through the reseeding a dead civilization from the dust, as the exiles are charged with. And in a sense, with the creation of a new universe as well, wherein the players are able to resurrect their extinct race.

                You've said that Homestuck is a creation myth. Is it fair to say that it's also explores the concept of consciousness after death, considering how the kernelsprites were prototyped with dead beings, and Vriska resurrecting herself via Dreamself.

            Not really. It's actually quite awful to be honest.<br>
    <br>
    I always thought one of the stupidest scenes in that was when John Malkovich made the little model of the junkyard to describe his plans to the other felons. Why was that necessary? It was stupid, and the plan was stupid.<br>
    <br>
    Also why was Chief O'Brien from Star Trek such an asshole? What was even his problem? What was up with that.<br>
    <br>
    Also sometimes I forget that A) Steve Buscemi and B) Dave Chappelle were in that, and it makes the movie worse whenever I remember.<br>
    <br>
    But it's one of those movies that I always watch hypnotically whenever it comes on tv. There are a bunch of really terrible movies that are like that, defying explanation. Twister was always like that, and this could easily have been a film on John's wall. Also, and this is a source of deep personal shame, Jerry Maguire is like that too. I really can't explain this, because it is literally one of the worst films of all time. I think it might be that Tom Cruise is weirdly hypnotizing through his aggressive intensity.<br>
    <br>
    Note these are all movies from the 90s because I completely checked out of popular culture in the early 2000's.

            Do I? I guess it seems that way.<br>
    <br>
    The thing is, if you make up a whole lot of nonsense, you have to make up names for everything. Portmanteaus are one route I take, like echeladder, sylladex, kernelsprite, kismesis, incipisphere, etc. Some are a really obvious slamming together of two recognizable words, some are a little more obscure, jumbling together simpler morphemes, or more basic roots of language. And when you think about it, there aren't really many other ways to come up with names for stuff than combining the atomic elements of language.<br>
    <br>
    Another route to take which is more straightforward is just using a simple existing word to name a concept, and I do that pretty often too. Grist, denizens, underlings, consorts, the veil, the furthest ring, and the names of all the planets, which are about as simple as it gets.<br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, you can just make up your own nonsense words, which is an idea that's a little unpalatable to me for this project. I think that's a bit of a slippery slope to full blown fictional language building, which to me seems anchored to a much more severe kind of universe building endeavor than I wish to engage in.<br>
    <br>
    The closest things to nonsense words might be names like Skaia, Derse, and Prospit, but even those are more like veiled portmanteaus. Skaia pretty obviously is sky+gaia, Derse you could view as an amalgam of dearth (scarcity) and terse (curt, abrupt, a word that could characterize someone like Jack), and Prospit is obviously prosperity and whatever myriad of words the suffix "it" might invoke. Perhaps esprit, which is a word in the mix of the matesprit portmanteau. So really this is just another way of saying that things in fiction that sound like nonsense are often portmanteaus in disguise.<br>
    <br>
    Troll names also sound like nonsense, but A) they were reader suggested and B) most of them have roots in other languages, usually pertaining to astrology. Of course since I was the one who selected the suggestions, my aversion to pure nonsense for this project had something to do with this outcome.

            I'm not sure that either qualifies. The whole leitmotif thing got pretty blurry after a while, the more songs I piled on. At this point I just go for cool music that I happen to develop a particular idea for without thinking about cementing any leitmotifs, like I once may have intended. But often you'll hear familiar themes in these pieces anyway.

            HS is getting old enough by now that the exact genesis of particular ideas is becoming hard to remember.<br>
    <br>
    But here it was likely a progression by asking a series of logical questions, surrounding a key initial idea.<br>
    <br>
    The idea being "punch card alchemy." Then I say, ok go, make that work.<br>
    <br>
    If each item is represented by a uniquely punched card, then combining them means combining the cards in some way. Overlapping and double punching is a simple enough conclusion.<br>
    <br>
    But then, what do you do with the cards?<br>
    <br>
    Put them in a machine.<br>
    <br>
    What machine? What does that machine do?<br>
    <br>
    It... makes something.<br>
    <br>
    Makes what?<br>
    <br>
    How about a totem? Also uniquely representing an item.<br>
    <br>
    What do you do with the totem?<br>
    <br>
    Put it on another machine that reads it somehow, and creates the item.<br>
    <br>
    All of this is both arrived at, and united by the themes I wanted to use to tie it together, which was various types of wood shop devices like lathes and miters, and other types of technology like old IBM card punchers, more modern laser scanners, and internet security gateways like captcha systems. And to have it all function as this sort of itemsmithing equivalent to something vaguely reminiscent of Platonic idealism. It was always meant to convey a truly esoteric forge, something a little otherworldly and in a way kind of sterile in aesthetic, like they were these odd modules of creative potential dropped from heaven. Or something.<br>
    <br>
    But the story's focus on that seems like a long time ago now, and since exploring that in depth and playing with it, we've moved on to a lot of other fun ideas and plot points, while those themes fell in the background, to be revisited very occasionally. Mostly now the whole system serves as something the reader understands already, and items are manufactured without illustration or mention of the process. And sometimes, without mention of even the manufacturing. Increasingly, items just show up in the story without fanfare. That type of granularity is no longer sensible at this stage. We have bigger fish to fry.

                Do "red feelings" refer to just flushed feelings, or pale as well?

    <div class="response-container">

            In the context it was used, most likely flushed.<br>
    <br>
    There's a lot of evidence that while all the quadrants are regarded as important, there's more emphasis and emotion surrounding the concupiscent one (those related to reproduction, as our concept of romance is), whereas the pale quadrants seem to be regarded as "the boring ones". Which is obviously a relatable set of circumstances for humans, even if the vernacular and cultural implications are different. So if they're talking about this stuff in a heated way, it's most likely about hearts/spades rather than clubs/diamonds.<br>
    <br>
    And on a side note, while we can certainly examine this stuff in a serious way as if engaging in a fictional sociological study, I feel it's important not to lose sight of the fact that this material is always meant to be rooted in humor. That's one of the big reason it exists in the first place, to set the stage for these ridiculous situations and absurd relationship dynamics and conflicts, with silly terms being thrown around leading to confusion. Much like a romantic comedy uses romantic tension we all understand to create ridiculous scenarios. This uses scifi romance principles to do the same. It's essentially a scifi romcom, but unlike a romcom which will usually at some point, if not frequently, place the romance ahead of the comedy for a sappy payoff, that's not what's going on here. I'd rather that humor always be in the forefront for HS. The details of troll romance, and all romance issues really, aren't meant to be taken all that seriously. It's all supposed to be pretty silly stuff. Romance is a foil for humor, to some extent character development, and little else.

                it seems* like you have amazing symmetry between stream-of-consciousness creativity AND intricate analytical observation. BUT, many people say an overly-analytical mind can kill a creative process. what are your thoughts? *chances are i'm wrong, though.

            That's probably true, but I don't think I'm that analytical when I create, i.e. write or draw. When I start working, I dive right in without thinking much, and don't stop til I'm done. I work pretty fast because of this.<br>
    <br>
    The end result is something complex through gradual accumulation, in a way that I try to make maniacally self consistent. But it's all built upon ideas that I spent a good deal of time thinking about and connecting before executing. Not moments before drawing, but in the days, weeks or months preceding, while I'm doing other things like walking around and running errands. Since all the key ideas already exist on sort of a road map in my head, executing becomes a pretty simple exercise, and allows for a lot of whimsy and snap decisions, as long as those decisions aren't in violation of the big picture.<br>
    <br>
    Suffice to say, there isn't a lot of analysis that goes into the process. But the result is something that can be analyzed quite extensively.

                Is the Problem Sleuth crew ever going to appear (from what i saw. I don't know if I missed any cameos or anything) the way the midnight crew does?

            The Midnight Crew was not a canonical element of Problem Sleuth. It started in a series of donation commands, and I thought it would be fun to elaborate on them in this story. This began with their appearance on the MSPA website in the HS universe, which John and co. could read on their computers. The original rationale was that this is what MSPA looked like in an alternate universe, because I considered doing a Midnight Crew story for MSPA after PS ended, instead of HS.<br>
    <br>
    Then this idea was further elaborated on when the MC was revealed to literally exist in a different universe, the one which the trolls lived in, and was the predecessor to our universe. In the HS universe, MSPA is a window to the story of the Midnight Crew taking place in the troll universe. In the troll universe, MSPA is the window to the Homestuck story taking place in the human universe. (though technically, they are windows to somewhat bastardized versions of those stories)<br>
    <br>
    This idea was developed in tandem with casting Jack and the agents as key villains, and constants between sessions, in the same sense that Bowser is the same villain throughout the various Mario games, though he experiences a different fate depending on which game you play or how you play it.<br>
    <br>
    I never liked the idea of including canonical Problem Sleuth characters (aside from Snoop Dogg) in Homestuck. And the more popular appeal the idea seemed to have and the more people asked me about it or theorized about it, the less I liked it for some reason. At this point it's safe to say it just isn't going to happen.

    I find it more interesting to make words most people know work in interesting or novel ways through combination and context than indulging in a lot of lexicographical obscurity.<br>

    To put it another way. Whenever I read a really peculiar word I've never seen before, my eyes don't light up. I'm more inclined to just say "Who cares."

            For the most part this is true. But movie clips are very touchy organisms, and I'm not completely convinced pause/playing some animations at certain frames won't mess up the timing. I'm standing by my "watch til it ends" recommendation.

                Do you still smoke? If so, does it have any effect on the production of Homestuck? It's worth noting that I'm not trying to make a "how high do you even have to BE" subtext in the question. I'm just curious.

            Why do you believe I ever did? I don't, and didn't.<br>
    <br>
    It's hard to underscore enough how ridiculous I and most creators I've talked to find this notion that being high is the wellspring from which all bizarre, absurd, or otherwise creative material must necessarily come from. For the most part, there's a very significant difference between quality work and pot addled horseshit.<br>
    <br>
    It's not that I think all drugs are JUST SO TERRIBLE on principle. But including them as a staple to the creative process is usually a serious detriment to the work in my view.<br>
    <br>
    But in looking at your question again, maybe you didn't hold this view anyway. Nonetheless, it's a topic that rears its head now and then.

                With regard to the longer animations: would it be possible to add a pause feature? It's not a big problem, but I often get interrupted in the middle and have to start all over. Other than that, I'm in love with everything about MSPA. Keep up the awesome.

            I've thought about some kind of nav system, but all things considered I'm fine with the simplicity of "open and watch til it ends".<br>
    <br>
    For one thing, a lot of the animations involve Flash "movie clips" all bundled together which makes implementing pausing a huge pain in the ass. I wouldn't stop using these either. It helps speed of production.<br>
    <br>
    Think of it like going to a movie. You go into it knowing you have no control over the flow of entertainment. In fact, it never even occurs to you. And everyone has always been fine with this.<br>
    <br>
    I'm also cool with the fact that Flash doesn't play on a lot of portable devices. Seems to me it's preferable that people park themselves in front of a proper display before watching these things.

            What isn't there to understand? Unless you're not following the story.<br>
    <br>
    Jade was asleep. Her dream self is dead, so she can no longer dream on Prospit. This is what she dreams instead. She dreams of the gods in the furthest ring, and meets Feferi there, who is simultaneously napping on the horn pile. She did so deliberately to encounter the gods and prove to everyone they were harmless, after her dream self was killed with the destruction of Derse in the troll session.<br>
    <br>
    Dave was also asleep. But his dream self is still alive, on the moon of Derse. He earlier had told Rose he'd take off his shades and look into the sky to observe the gods. He presumably caught a glimpse of Jade's dream, or at least the gods in general.<br>
    <br>
    Then Jade woke up.

            Why Squiddles? I don't really understand the question, but I'll state the obvious. Squiddles I guess are a sort of candy coated representation of the outer gods. Not literally. They are a brand in a fictional universe. A cartoon show. They were not necessarily conjured into existence by the gods, via dark conspiracy either. It's more likely that humans created them as an echo of their subconscious awareness that these gods exist, and present them through this cute, approachable facade.<br>
    <br>
    As for the song, it it's the other way around. This animation likely would not have ever been made if the song hadn't existed for some time already.

            What's going on here is a bit of a mythology melange.<br>
    <br>
    There's Arthurian legend, but it's also getting mixed in with the blatant lord of the Rings stuff, with the broken sword slashing magic rings off the hands of evil overlords, magic volcanoes, quests to protect the ring, the great big blazing sun reminiscent of the Eye of Sauron which has become a symbolic refrain itself, and even Dave's name: Strider. But of course, I'm sure Tolkien's stuff had its share of Arthurian influence in there as well. It's hard to escape those archetypes when you're dealing with that material. Hell, maybe it was even part of the whole point for him. I don't actually know that much about LotR.<br>
    <br>
    Now, does all this MEAN something?<br>
    <br>
    I don't have very lofty purposes for it. It's fun to connect an elaborate fantasy tale, especially one as whimsical as this, with points of mythology entrenched in modern culture and universally recognized. These are symbols we all recognize, and in this case sort of stand in for the grandeur of a multi-threaded quest which will not necessarily ever be at the forefront of what we're shown, or what the story treats as most important.<br>
    <br>
    You might notice as you read that quest details are never all that important. There's a lot of stuff that's glossed over, conversed about casually, or even flippantly. Sometimes the characters even mock the quest details, making fun of the silly and useless puzzles they're meant to solve. That's because the quests are a backdrop to the more relevant focus of the story, which is the characters and their relationships, and the much heavier plot events that transcend the quest details. Like Noir's insurgence or Rose's commitment to game breaking. All the most important plot points have to to with the subversion of more conventional quest elements.

                What do you think about the theory of time being the 4th dimension? If it were true it sounds quite a lot like the outer gods and several other powers that be are actually 4th dimensional residents manipulating our group for reasons unknown

            I don't know if this really qualifies as a theory though.<br>
    <br>
    Practically speaking, we use three dimensions to plot coordinates and make measurements in space.<br>
    <br>
    We use a fourth dimension as well if we want to include time in those measurements. This is done all the time in even very simple physics, as well as 3D modeling. It's practical, not theoretical.<br>
    <br>
    Whether time TRULY, ACTUALLY IS the 4th dimension seems to me like more of a metaphysical consideration.<br>
    <br>
    Actually I just remembered I did a science fair thing on this subject in middle school.

            I really have no idea.<br>
    <br>
    It's Welsh.<br>
    <br>
    I could have gone with Caledbolg, another name for the Aurthurian sword, but there were a couple things -fwlch had going for it.<br>
    <br>
    One, it translates as "hard break", which I thought was thematically appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    Two, it's a shorter phonetic hop to Caledscratch, a name which is thematically on the money for THAT sword. In fact, that was named in advance knowing the sword that produced it would be called Caledfwlch.<br>
    <br>
    And in fact, the whole legendary piece of shit gag was something I planned to do down the road, the moment Dave originally broke his cheap piece of shit sword.

            Never been asked. A movie would be cool though I think.<br>
    <br>
    It would have to be so different though as to be almost unrecognizable, other than what exists at the heart of the story. Which is about the four main characters, their relationships as internet friends, the themes involving coming of age and discovery through this fantastical game setting, and that's about it.<br>
    <br>
    So much would have to be slashed, unless the thing sprawled into a monstrous trilogy, or N_logy. Most likely the casualties would include: everything about the trolls, everything about the post apocalypse exiles, vast amounts of fucking around with game mechanics, and probably even the kid/guardian relationships. It would require a complete redelivery of the concept of the game as a mechanism of creation myth.<br>
    <br>
    This comes with the peril of being regarded as heresy, but I wouldn't view it that way, because like I said, it is an utter impossibility to capture what this is precisely through cinema, just as it would be through a book. But reformatting the work to fit different kinds of media I think is a challenge I'd embrace. I don't regard the exact details of the story as it is now as something all that precious. I think there are fundamentals beneath all that which are more important. I always saw HS as an exploration of young people developing relationships over the internet, which is something a lot of people reading it can relate to, and a concept sort of under-represented in fiction of all kinds. I've explored that from a lot of angles so far, at first with the kids amongst each other, delving into existing relationships, and then with the trolls, which has been an exploration of forging new ones, and in particular one of making friends out of adversaries. There's a lot more to HS than just that obviously, but if there's anything which it's been about through and through, it's modern kids relating to each other from afar, developing as people and growing up.

            I keep the art asset demands pretty vague. Basic descriptions of backdrops, characters doing things etc, without being explicit about what's going on. Contributing artists can infer things, but don't understand the full picture until everyone else does.<br>
    <br>
    Then I assess what I've got, fill in a lot of the holes with my own drawing, particularly story-critical stuff, and assemble it all quite organically.<br>
    <br>
    There is no storyboard. I piece it together 100% linearly, on the fly, with decisions surrounding events and timing informed mostly by the music.

                Don't you think that judging ones art solely with ones own perspective can be a dangerous trap? I admire your strength of view but I can't help but think that disregarding all external critique could be somewhat toxic to your artistic development.

            Working the pixel sprites into the fold obviously came on the heels of the interactive RPG page. That page served all the obvious purposes is was meant to, but as a bonus, introduced another style I can resort to now and then, even in static pages. It's in the story, the precedent is set, so there's no reason not to go with it sometimes. There will probably be a rationale any time I go with it. As an iconic style it can communicate different things than the other styles. For now, I've just resorted to it as a fresh look.<br>
    <br>
    I also used it as sort of a springboard to launch the more detailed style exploration. The main thought process was, if one hyper-simplified style was just introduced, why not another one on the opposite side of the spectrum? Hence the transition from one to the other, and now back and forth and dancing in between through subsequent pages. It's sort of a study of two extremes now in the arsenal as I move forward. The older styles between them will surely be more common moving forward, but this juxtaposition is a statement meant to get you conscious of the style decisions, and the overall stylistic nature of this story.<br>
    <br>
    And that nature is, slowly but surely, revealing to us that it can be anything, at any time. Its nature is to accumulate visual complexity/diversity to eventually match conceptual complexity/diversity.

                Will we end up seeing anyone else drawn in this new style, or is it something more specific to Rose right now? Like, she's being shown in this jarringly new style to mirror how she's changing as she delves into these things that no sane person would?

            I think it's better not to over-complicate the symbolism behind when a drawing style is used.<br>
    <br>
    It's not that swapping styles has no meaning at all, but attributing a more serious rendering style to a sudden examination of SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES or whatever seems really heavy handed to me, and doesn't interest me that much.<br>
    <br>
    If you look at older pages, the more dynamic style was implemented during more dramatic moments, sure. But it was also used for some pretty casual moments. The criteria here just isn't that rigid or clear cut, and I wouldn't want it to be. There's kind of a subtle ebb and flow to when the styles get switched up having to do with my whim, which can also be viewed as the pulse of the story.<br>
    <br>
    Right now, the introduction of these styles doesn't mean a whole lot, other than making the simple statement that they are now in the fold. I'd rather they come in under the radar like this than ushered in with a serious event. Like WHOA SHIT ROSE JUST DIED or something CHECK OUT HOW SERIOUS THAT IS, AS ILLUSTRATED BY THIS MORE SERIOUS DRAWING STYLE. That would brand the style too heavily as a utility meant to carry out serious business, and that's not what I want.

    The "trolling the fans" thing is deceptive though. Because I disagree with them that the things they're complaining about are bad. So I am only putting more attention into elaborating on something which I thought was a cool idea in the first place, and in a way, simultaneously challenging them to change their minds on the subject. It's like a trial by fire. You have to come around and learn to appreciate the thing you took issue with before you earn your right to enjoy the rest of the story, and similarly, a challenge to me to perhaps make it work for them through the elaboration process.

            I guess I just believe in sticking to your guns as a creator. It doesn't mean you completely ignore what people have to say or fail to take it under advisement, but pandering and caving into critics for fear of diminished appreciation is the wrong way to go. Staying the course with your vision doesn't mean you'll do everything right, but if included in that vision is serious, concerted exploration, you can only benefit as an artist. Adversaries to this cause should be regarded as villains.<br>
    <br>
    There are two ways to do the "obstinate douche bag" thing as an artist.<br>
    <br>
    One is in vehement defense of stagnation. Some artists I've encountered do this, and it's completely indefensible. It's as low as you can get, creatively speaking.<br>
    <br>
    The other is in vehement defense of exploration. This is just the opposite. This is a posture everyone should strive for, and these artists are the ones people should be most inclined to offer their attention and support.<br>
    <br>
    That's just how I feel about it, and I come from a zero-BS standpoint on it all. This isn't a job for me, and I'll never modify my approach to protect a bottom line. If it was just a job, I guarantee I wouldn't spend every waking hour doing it. It's kind of a strange personal mission I'm on, which I happen to make money from, and that's cool. People are welcome to come along for the ride.

                The style of drawing that Rose's pixel sprite fades into makes me feel really, really uncomfortable. Is this the feeling that the drawings are supposed to evoke? It must be, especially with 004709's Powerpuff girl eyes! Ahhh I don't get it. :/

            It's not what it's supposed to evoke. You've made the classic blunder of mistaking your point of view for objective reality.<br>
    <br>
    It's fair to say the style just doesn't sit well with you, and that's true of some other people as well. But entangled with this issue is that it's something new and unexpected projected against something much simpler, as well as against everything we're used to seeing.<br>
    <br>
    There will always be those who are squeamish about sudden changes, and those people will absolutely never cop to it. They will always suggest their dissatisfaction is not because a thing is different, but because a thing is BAAAAAAAAD, and they'll have their laundry list of points to prove it, and they'll come packing hyperbole just to make sure you're TOTALLY convinced.<br>
    <br>
    The bias of anti-change corrupts the critical faculty. This story is built on perpetual change and evolution. This is a drill I'm very familiar with. So I have a hard time taking detractors seriously, and as usual, put a lot more stock in my own judgment.<br>
    <br>
    It gets particularly ridiculous when fielding issues about the merits of an art style from people who obviously know nothing about art. The truth behind the situation is some folks got "squicked" by the contextual delivery of a different style, and then rationalize the reaction by identifying all these problems with the art completely independent of the context in which their reaction occurred, through the lens of someone who's never given two shits about serious artistic analysis.<br>
    <br>
    So maybe there are some iffy things going on with anatomy? Stylistic misfires in the features? Alright, maybe this is fair to discuss. Even though really breaking down one of these images is sort of missing the bigger point here, this is what I had to say about one drawing for the record.<br>
    <br>
    -----<br>
    "Is it a clinic on human anatomy? Of course not. Sort of an absurd standard to hold it to. It is, like many drawings, a balance between accuracy and stylization. It's a slightly exaggerated "gawking pose", because of course the laptop is on the ground, and she's presumably now sitting on the ground and stooping lower to see it. It furthermore conveys body language I thought was appropriate for A) a gangly awkward teenager, and B) someone nonplussed by a ridiculous internet conversation.<br>
    <br>
    There's a bit of wonkiness to the stylization mixed in with the amped realism. The edges are chewed up a little more than usual. Stray pixels and 1-pixel lines dart in and out of forms. This is not an immaculate presentation, and by design. But the anatomy is roughly accurate regardless, for what it is. The virtual spine does indeed connect with the base of the virtual skull where it should, given the posture. The face, from a semi-realistic comic stylization standpoint is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. The mouth is conveyed as slightly open through minimalism."<br>
    -----<br>
    <br>
    This is getting down to the artistic issues in an intelligent way, and you may agree or disagree, but like I said, this is sort of missing the bigger point. For one thing, in what has been an obvious exercise in visual/stylistic volatility all along, to hold yet another emergent style to such scrutiny or as something that doesn't belong strikes me as a little petty in the grand scheme of things, as a willful misapprehension of the nature of the work, and as just another instance of "change allergy" rearing its head. Just another missed opportunity for that omnipresent group of people who can never manage to just roll with something when it's introduced rather than gnashing their teeth about it, eventually get used to it, and then later pretend they were down with it all along.<br>
    <br>
    But this isn't even what bugs me about it. You can dislike a drawing I did. I don't care about that at all.<br>
    <br>
    What I find really irritating is when troglodytes from the internet chirp up and bombastically suggest their judgment is better than mine when it comes to the aesthetic direction of this thing, or really any kind of direction for that matter. It's like they managed to forget whose judgment brought the thing they presumably enjoy to where it is in the first place. I don't like it whenever I get the sense that Homestuck is a sacred cow in the mind of a reader, and if I do something "wrong", I'm kicking that cow. It doesn't belong to you. The cow is mine, and you are enjoying its milk at my discretion.<br>
    <br>
    Vehement detractors will almost certainly contribute to my inclination to continue to produce what upsets them, likely more so than I initially intended, and this has been the case since the start of Homestuck. Bored by sylladex shenanigans? Get ready for a lot more fucking around. Impatient with the troll arc? Whoops, time to slow it down! Uh oh, don't like detailed drawings that much? Hmmmmmm.<br>
    <br>
    If I actually manage to jettison the disgruntled parties from the readership, I consider that an added bonus. Like spiking the football after the touchdown.<br>
    <br>
    That dude dancing in the end zone over there? That's the MVP.

            Possibly, verging on probably.<br>
    <br>
    Believe it or not, this was supposed to be an "easy one". It got a little out of hand with feature sprawl, as should be painfully predictable to me by now.<br>
    <br>
    The primary purpose of this idea initially was to create a simple, fun format emulating RPG gameplay, particularly the sort of moments where you explore a village, talk to as many people as you can, and start piecing together clues for the game's story bit by bit. I thought it would be a good way to load up on a lot of cross-interaction between many different characters without resorting to a huge linear dump of extensive pesterlogs. And it was successful in this sense. I just thought it would be easier, involving a few character sprites, a few room tiles, a simple adaptation of Alexis's existing Flash engine, and a whole lot of writing by me (that part still turned out to be true).<br>
    <br>
    But in the end I think it was worth it to go a little extra further with it and come closer to capturing a more immersive feel to playing an RPG like this. Learning about story details in this manner is something so many people are very familiar with. Anyone who's ever even casually played RPGs has spent many hours doing it. And yet it feels strikingly novel to me in this context, encountering a page like this and switching your mindset on how you're being fed information necessary to advance the story. Suddenly the burden is on you to take action and piece the full picture together yourself. It's a little like doing detective work. Which is exactly what it's like exploring a village in an RPG. The various NPCs lurking around town are always alluding to things, rarely being all that explicit. Alluding to some peril in another town which might ring a bell if you've already visited that town, or will ring a bell later when you eventually do. Or talking to a person on one side of town whose story connects with a person on the other side. It's a pretty interesting angle on storytelling, that is to say, having to account for the reader's free will over data intake, which is a complete non-issue outside of interactive media, and one we probably take for granted as a story building method because we're not really thinking of it that way when playing a game. The purpose is to explore and advance, not to be led through narrative as we're accustomed to in other formats. And yet, after fully exploring a town, the end result is similar to having read a coherent story. You proceed armed with details and references which will prepare you for later story events.<br>
    <br>
    And it does seem to be a pretty effective way to paint a portrait of a situation. Even more so when you aren't mining information from flat, monologuing NPCs, but established characters having back and forth conversations. It's probably hard for me to be objective about this since I'm up to my neck in it, but after playing all the way through, I get the feeling that even someone who knew nothing about the story or the characters would have a pretty good sense for what was going on after running through it all. They're aliens, stranded on a meteor, hiding from a demon, discovering another race called humans with their computers, conversing with their past/future selves, each with allusions to a distinct backstory, many characters with clear types of preexisting relationships with each other, and so on. There's really a ton of information conveyed through this, directly and through inference, without any exposition, and all absorbed very rapidly through a universally friendly, accessible format.

                Yo, Hussmaster A. I was wondering if you could clarify the black Pesterchum bubbles. Is it simply because the trolls wear black shirts, or is it meant to be more sinister?

            It just looked cool, and it kind of mixes it up. Also I happened to have more detailed zodiac icons from making the shirts, so I stuck em in there.<br>

    Sometimes things are just that simple.

                Beyond Homestuck, I don't know of any other works that resolve so serendipitously are so meticulously crafted. I admit that I skipped some of the troll arc, but even there I cannot but admire your embellishment of the characters. Thanks for HS and MSPA!

    Personally, I think you should go back and read the troll arc. Every last word. This story thrives on details, and virtually no detail is irrelevant. Skipping some will only erode your full comprehension and appreciation for what is happening.

            Primarily because it was confusing to new readers. Many people we genuinely duped into believing this thing was playable somehow, and confused for a while before finally figuring it out. Kind of unnecessary.

    Playing dressup with your characters will always be one of the guilty pleasures of being a creator. But also, it's pretty in keeping with RPG games this thing draws from. Characters are always getting new sweet gear as they advance.

                What's the deal with the schizo storytelling still? I understand using that format for Hivebent, but now that we're with the kids must we still have micro-time jumps and have every statement be enigmatic? What happened to the slow build and discovery?

            What's the deal with the phrase "what's the deal with"? The deal with it is what you see and read. That's how it is.<br>
    <br>
    Were you expecting absolute reversion to earlier story progression rhythms? You were wrong to do so. What is it about this story, this format, or this website which would make you anticipate static, unevolving patterns? Is there criticism and disapproval buried in your question? [Yes.] That's cool. But if you've made it this far, you should now be familiar with the concept of storytelling in a state of perpetual flux. Your observation strikes me as a little obtuse.<br>
    <br>
    I believe the reader is well prepared for every shift in the nature of the story's unfolding. There are primers on what to expect along the way. Very early, when we first met Dave, we began a humble exercise in non-linear pacing. Conversations he had with John and Rose, then revisited from an earlier timeframe from his perspective. Some nonlinear revisitations with Jade's story as well. It wasn't just messing around. It established that time was something to be tinkered with in this story, more intensively as we progress. The MC intermission was a primer on complicated time travel dynamics taking center stage in the story. It was a tangent, quite silly and convoluted, but very good preparation for the concepts to follow, which have dominated the story since. The troll arc was a very aggressive primer on completely off the rails nonlinear story progression, which has somewhat extended beyond it into the main story, and will continue to do so. All of these primer concepts are now firing on all cylinders at once. And the word primer is the title of a very complicated time travel movie, which I have not seen yet. I imagine watching it would serve as a decent primer for reading Homestuck.<br>
    <br>
    This is what the story is. There is no "real story" I need to "get back to" as you imply.

            Is nature really so utilitarian? When you look at all the crazy diversity in earth biology, can you really say that only that which is strictly necessary is what exists? Why do some birds develop such elaborate mating dances when simpler ones would suffice? Choose your own example.<br>
    <br>
    There's plenty we don't know about their biology, nor will we ever. There are lots of possible explanations. Vestigial genders. An unknown role gender still plays in reproduction, noncomparable to anything on this planet. Choose your own explanation.<br>

    The real answer of course is because it makes the ensemble more fun and more relatable to us.

                Now that Hivebent is apparently over, is there anything you wish you could change about it?
            </a>
        </h2>
        <div class="cright"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="response-container">
        <p>
            Nope!<br>
    <br>
    That's all the questions I'll answer for now.<br>
    <br>
    On the subject of this question, let's look at some...<br>
    <br>
    HIVEBENT STATS<br>
    <br>
    98 days<br>
    635 pages<br>
    737 images<br>
    1 three minute flash animation<br>
    70,000 words<br>
    <br>
    7.5 images per day<br>
    714 words per day<br>
    <br>
    Hivebent definitely went at a faster clip than usual for MSPA, in both image and word output. The word count spike seems especially pronounced.<br>
    <br>
    But this was a deliberate effort, and not really just for the sake of a more compressed, sweeping story.<br>
    <br>
    A while ago, months before Hivebent, I had the thought that I wanted to allow words to tow more of the load in what has been mostly a visual format (MSPA as a whole I mean). The trend had already been present in HS, with increasing importance given to pesterlogs to drive the story, and I've found the consequences to be interesting, and not really expected from the onset of HS.<br>
    <br>
    So Hivebent represents more of a verbal push, I guess in part as a media exploration. It's not too inaccurate to describe it as a very vividly illustrated e-novel. I understand of course this is not what 100% of all readers have a strong appetite for, and that's fine with me. Reading through HS and then hitting Hivebent is a little like suddenly encountering thicker atmosphere in flight. The rate of progress slows, it demands a little more attention, and then when you get through it, the pace picks back up. (Probably!) Overall, I'm satisfied with how it turned out, and it reads pretty much how I thought it would. It just lasted a couple months longer than I projected, because I will absolutely never be able to pin down an accurate time estimate on a story arc. I have resolved to stop trying, ever.<br>
    <br>
    Text-heavy visual storytelling is something I've thought about recently beyond the scope of this arc, and I think there are some interesting possibilities to explore. Perhaps I will, but I doubt what I'd have in mind would be compatible with the MSPA format. Perhaps after HS. We'll see.

    The zodiac thing is completely irrelevant. There is nothing special about the constellations, as I answered below. The people of Earth assigned the meanings to those stars. Any planet in the universe could have a similar zodiac, but with different looking constellations. Perhaps all of them do.<br>
    <br>
    Maybe Earth is the "paradise planet" mentioned once or twice. Maybe they could have settled there. Are trolls really prone to settle? Maybe if they were successful, they would have conquered instead. It's all a moot point obviously.<br>
    <br>
    Earth is less special as a place the trolls are destined to settle, and more special as a place where the kids were born. The kids who would go on the adventure that would be completely tangled up with the adventure the trolls just went on.

            The trolls probably wouldn't answer your prayers even if they presided over us unfettered.<br>
    <br>
    But they aren't literally gods. They would certainly feel like it, having made the universe and then going wherever they wanted, existing as very powerful warriors from all their battle experience and high grade gear.<br>
    <br>
    There are other entities and forces in this multiverse reality that could be seen as more god-like. The many instances of Skaia, for one. Whatever it is, exactly. The more sinister outer gods. Omnipotent beings like English, Scratch, Snowman, Bec. The mysterious frog god briefly mentioned, "Bilious Slick". All this stuff alludes to a pretty lively scene beyond the grasp of mortals. Players of the game appear to be just more pawns in the process of perpetuating reality. They're heroes, sure. And their stories likely wind up being the most interesting in this reality. But they're still just a bunch of mortal kids.<br>
    <br>
    But we do see evidence that their story elevates them to godhood in the mythology of the people who eventually populate the universe they create. The constellations in our zodiac are just arbitrary looking star clusters, but people in our history saw them as symbols of the 12 creators, and built a whole mystical framework around their story. The specifics of the story may have been lost over time, or may never have been known. It could just be that the way our universe was created is imprinted in their subconscious, and it surfaces symbolically in their stories.<br>
    <br>
    This was actually my line of thinking in writing Rose's wizardfic. If you sift through that dense excerpt, you find it's about 12 evil kids who played a role in influencing every dark event in history. My intent was that this was her subconsciously echoing the creation story of her own universe.<br>
    <br>
    You could also extend their influence to the personality profiles of the characters. There are a lot of similarities between the profiles of many of the trolls and the kids. Some trolls seem to share traits with more than one kid. This is to be expected to some extent, since some of the profile elements are pretty broad. But in some cases the crossover is harder to ignore, and this could be attributed to the Alternian heroes laying the psychological tracks for the heroes that arise in the universe they create. But that said, I didn't want to get too carried away with this idea, and just make the "Dave version" of the trolls, and so on. So I drew similarities at times, and exaggerated differences at others, hoping to strike a balance.

            It's a real shirt. In his letter to Jade, he said he got her the blue ghost shirt for her birthday, at the same time as when he got his own green ghost shirt. So he was wearing a different shirt before that. We just didn't know what it was.<br>
    <br>
    Turns out it was a spade shirt. There is not a huge amount of significance to this other than 1) he likes magic and card tricks, and all the Harry Anderson stuff in his room reminds of this, 2) it is the symbol favored by Jack Noir, the bad guy he's destined to face in this game, and 3) it is taken by Karkat as an omen that this kid he just discovered was meant to be his kismesis. Hate at first sight.<br>
    <br>
    But then he switched to his ghost shirt on Jade's birthday, which was also when he resolved to change his handle from ghostyTrickster to ectoBiologist, just after Terezi trolled him for the first time and threatened to kill him.

        <div class="cright"></div>

    <div class="response-container">
        <p>
            Since before Homestuck started.<br>
    <br>
    HS was always going to be a story about an extremely elaborate creation myth. As elaborate as I could conceive. In the HS reality, Sburb/Sgrub is the means by which universes procreate. Planets and civilizations are the seeds from which one or many new universes will blossom if the players succeed, at the expense of the life on that planet.<br>
    <br>
    This was always what Homestuck was about. This revelation was carefully guarded, although there are plenty of clues. It has taken 4.5 acts to understand the "what" (as well as some of the "how" along the way.) The rest of the story will be about exploring the rest of the "how", as well as determining whether the players succeed.<br>
    <br>
    I've answered numerous times that the conception of HS had its roots in loosely combining the themes and feel of Earthbound, The Sims, and Spore. That was a formula concocted many months before I began the story, well before Problem Sleuth was finished. The story still strikes me as staying very close to that original vision. Only now does the Spore component seems like it makes more sense. "Sburb" was always a word that was supposed to be reminiscent of "Spore", tweaked to reference the house building element as well. Spore is about universe building, and more specifically, life form and civilization building, but from the microscopic to the macroscopic. Sburb is the reverse. The goal is to create a universe all at once after overcoming an extensive series of challenges, and as is implied, the universe fleshes itself out with galaxies and systems and planets and lifeforms, ready and waiting for entry by the victorious players. The ultimate reward is for the players to enter the universe they created and do as they see fit. They are essentially the gods of that universe, and that is what the trolls are to our universe.<br>
    <br>
    The trolls were always meant to serve this purpose. Before I conceptualized them in any way at all, their primary description was "the group of players who created our universe by successfully completing Sburb, and who would interact with the kids in some way and help them understand the purpose of the game". Logically, the other group of players would have to be aliens, since they are not only from a different planet, but from an entirely different universe. This began the thought process that lead to making them trolls, and then specifically, internet trolls who would harass the kids, but ultimately support them as the group of veteran players who understood what was going on better than any of the kids. This was mainly solidified because I thought the concept of our universe being created by a bunch of cantankerous internet trolls was a funny idea.<br>
    <br>
    But at the time I didn't expect to get as deep into their story as I eventually did. I figured I'd touch upon it in some limited way, and only introduce a handful of characters, and just keep trucking along with the kids. But as their story became more entangled with the kids' story, it felt more necessary to just go all the way and get into their adventure, not just to better contextualize and characterize them all, but as a sort of accelerated primer on the entire game objective itself. The story is certainly about four kids and their adventure together, but also at its heart, it is about this esoteric creation myth, and the troll arc became a good way to establish the true objective while getting a foothold of the scope and magnitude of it all. We got a different look at how another session could go, with a much different player count and personality ensemble, and all the ways that could contribute to variations in this highly flexible game, and ultimately what the point of all this is. All this diversity and flexibility in the game's unfolding presumably has a bearing on what type of universe will be created. These ideas will be explored in detail over the remainder of the story. There's a lot more to come.<br>
    <br>
    The deeper I've gone into involving the trolls in the story, the more it seems to me they were never an element I could really just shrug off in favor of focusing on "the real story". The process of going through their story has had an effect in showing the nature of the game that could never have been achieved without going down that road. Without it, I'd have to resort to a more mundane expository means of revealing the game's purpose. The Felt intermission, which certainly seemed tangential (and surely was) still served an important purpose by helping us invest in the villainous nature of Jack Noir. Without that, his future actions would have much less meaning. Similarly, the troll arc has served to more thoroughly "characterize" the entire purpose of the game, and give it much more meaning going forward. Furthermore, the troll story is inextricably entwined with the kids. Actions of the kids had influence over the way the troll adventure unfolded, and therefore the way their own universe was created (Rose's gamefaqs, the scratch they create, just to name what we know of). The kids' adventure is obviously heavily influenced by the trolls through direct communication, and therefore the trolls have a hand in causing the kids to do whatever it was they did to impact the troll's adventure, and so on. Willingly or not, they're all working toward the same outcome, toward creating our universe, and the universe the kids are trying to create, and whatever trouble puts all that in jeopardy. Remember that both the kids' and the trolls' chum handles are needed to make the full set of ACGT combinations. They are not two unrelated groups of players as they first appeared, nor are their universes unrelated. Sollux's shades, the ~ATH code, etc help illustrate this, that they are bifurcated, interwoven realities.<br>
    <br>
    Even Act 5 is a microcosm of this idea. It is a bifurcated act. Act 5.1 is the troll half. Act 5.2 is the kid half. 5.2 even begins with two sets of curtains, red and blue. Blue symbolizes the troll universe, red symbolizes our universe. First we crossed through blue, then red.<br>
    <br>
    One last thing I'll mention about all this. The whole creation myth angle of Homestuck was almost entirely inspired by the ludicrous creation myth in Problem Sleuth, the way GPI used his imaginary time traveling duplicates to create all the matter in the universe. I think that was one of my personal favorite ideas to come out of that story, in terms of scope and absurdity. So when I was considering ideas for the next story, I thought it would be fun to develop that topic further, but with a little less absurdity and more depth, sophistication and complexity. And for the creation myth to exist as the centerpiece of the game purpose and story.

            You seem to be making this more complicated than it is.<br>
    <br>
    First of all, if you stare at the sun for a while, you go blind. Even if that's not 100% technically true, that's the reality everyone understands. You don't need to be especially photosensitive.<br>
    <br>
    When Terezi stared at the sun, her real self went blind. This is a simple fact.<br>
    <br>
    When her dream self stared at Skaia, this is open to interpretation. Does staring into the heart of Skaia for a while cause your dream self to go blind? Maybe staring at it in conjunction with your real self staring at the sun is what does it? OR! Maybe staring at Skaia doesn't make your dream self go blind at all. Maybe her dream self went blind simply because her real self did, and like she explained to Karkat, her mental self image kept the blindness in her dreams because she wanted to be that way, because it helped her continue to connect with her lusus and learn a new way to see. There are a number of ways to look at this.<br>
    <br>
    The psychic relay that made her sleepwalk also involves some subtleties. (Though this wasn't actually part of the question.)<br>
    <br>
    Vriska commandeered Tavros's mind to get him to use his psychic powers. That's pretty obvious. He then communed with Terezi's dragon. The dragon then connected with the mind of sleeping Terezi. But what happens then does not appear to be straightup mind control, as Vriska usually employs. Terezi was happily sleepwalking along, not proceeding with the zombie shuffle that mind control victims usually exhibit.<br>
    <br>
    It seems that the dragon's psychic ability was used to influence Terezi in a more subtle way, without issuing firm commands. More like a suggestion. It suggested in her dream that she get up, look into the sky and open her eyes. This is simultaneously implementing Vriska's revenge ploy by getting her real self to sleepwalk and look at the sun, as well as implementing the dragon's primal intent to get Terezi's dream self to become aware of Skaia and wake up. Her unhatched dragon, as a sort of mystical guide, presumably is aware of Skaia and her fate, and continues to act as such as it teaches her to see while blind in her dreams.<br>
    <br>
    Vriska simply used the dragon's unharnessed impulse to do this as a matter of convenience, working under the constraints she had. She may have had this contingency prepared in advance even, much like Terezi had a plan prepared to take Vriska out utilizing Scratch.

            I remember that, and it was in the mix of influences for sure. I recall there were others speculating about sun-staring as a cause. It's one reasonably obvious thing to speculate. What else is there? Daggers to the eyes... hot coffee spill? I don't know. The practical list is probably underwhelming.<br>
    <br>
    But the "what" isn't all that interesting. It's the "how" that required a little thought and ingenuity.

            Not how much it's grown, which it's obvious, but how it changes in nature so subtly and gradually.<br>
    <br>
    Readers during PS had a certain energy reflected in the nature of the story. Hard to describe. Very meme and gag driven, but that's a bit simplistic.<br>
    <br>
    Now the readers have a very different energy. The kind of readership that seems to be resonating with some of the soap opera qualities of the Hivebent drama, which is something so far afield of PS it's ridiculous.<br>
    <br>
    And the really funny thing is there is a HUGE amount of overlap between these two groups of people. They have just gradually modified their appetites for the type of entertainment being dispensed.<br>
    <br>
    Not everyone has though. Some stormed off in a huff when they saw John fuck around in his room for two solid months, or when we watched a bunch of alien kids get really emotional for three months. (although they are all still secretly visiting the website! shhhhh)

            Oh hey thanks! They are definitely fun to write.<br>

    They took a little longer than normal logs, but mostly because they were just longer. The fact that there were multiple participants from varying points on the timeline, including past and future duplicates of the same person, added a little complexity. But by now I'm pretty used to sorting through that kind of stuff.<br>
    <br>
    But that complexity does breed longer logs, I found. It's hard to have them serve their purpose without making them longer.<br>

    There'll probably be more of these later.

                Some critics charge that you are immune to criticism. Do you think there are any legitimate complaints that get lost in the trend of "THIS ISN'T PROBLEM SLEUTH 2 SO IT SUCKS"? More generally, do you perceive any failures in your execution so far?
            </a>
        </h2>
        <div class="cright"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="response-container">
        <p>
            I'm not immune to criticism nor do I regard my work as perfect at all. It has plenty of flaws and by and large I know what they are.<br>
    <br>
    Understanding these flaws already might make me seem "immune", or at least indifferent to criticism. I can't recall being blindsided by an intelligent criticism which hadn't already occurred to me myself. Usually I look at a decision from a lot of angles, examine the pitfalls, and often proceed in spite of the pitfalls for whatever reasons I have. There are always reasons behind these judgments. Also a lot of what happens with MSPA is a learning process based on experimental approach. Experimentation is often what informs decisions against more universally sound creative judgment. But when the dust has settled after a certain experimental phase, I generally have all the faults with it well in hand, and many of them were anticipated. I can see myself what worked and didn't work so well. By the time a critic comes knocking they aren't telling me anything new. I've already spent ten times longer thinking about it than he has. Probably longer. Anyone trying to school me on this stuff frankly is just barking up the wrong tree.<br>
    <br>
    Implicit in this is that I often agree with critics, especially if they really "got it". I agree qualitatively. What I don't agree with is critical editorializing. And example of a qualitative observation would be "this is a bit wordy" to which I respond "yes I agree." Where we differ is when the critic feels the need to say "and that's bad bad bad you should stop stop stop!" to which I reply "no no no!" Because obviously I already thought it through and accepted the consequences of that decision. It is what I wanted it to be, and exactly what I thought it would be, pitfalls and all, for reasons I can articulate if needed. Demanding critics want more from you though. They wish for concessions to their point of view. It seems more emotional than logical.<br>
    <br>
    Many critics are very naive in this sense, and these people I would not even regard as real critics at all. More like just complainers. They leverage their dissatisfaction under the guise of criticism, and if their grievances are dismissed, the creator is accused of being deaf to criticism. A little like suitors spurned by a woman will accuse her of being icy. Creators have a responsibility to vet their critics, to know how deep the critic's appreciation and understanding of the material is first before putting value on their advice. To understand whether the critic is capable of quality thought and observation. To apply a critical process to the critic itself. Some critics believe they themselves are immune to criticism! Not all opinions and perspectives are equal, and it's dangerous and incredibly stupid for creators to treat them as such. Would you take advice on how to improve your life from a retarded person? You see, we actually do this every day. We vet those who would counsel us on our daily lives, who we would trust to guide us in the right direction.

    There are a number of lesser reasons for this which might be difficult to express concisely. But the primary one is a bit of subtle foreshadowing to the ensuing animation.<br>
    <br>
    Notice the parallels between Skaia and the sun, the location they are both anchored to, and the character looking directly at it in the latter instance.<br>
    <br>
    Does that mean Terezi has some weird cosmic correlation with Sweet Bro? Nah. The parallel isn't perfect. It was just a silly thing that occurred to me to do.<br>
    <br>
    Primarily because it was funny.

            SBAHJ like anything undergoes artistic evolution. It will gradually stray from original purpose to explore different artistic statements.<br>
    <br>
    Do you really believe the goal is to strive for anything approaching realism at this point? To mimic a poorly constructed comic done in earnest?<br>
    <br>
    Why does it seem like I'm trying too hard? It seems that way to you because you clearly have no idea what I am actually trying to do.<br>
    <br>
    What if the model for the first few strips had persisted, and I'd adhered to it religiously? Would it have stayed funny? For how long? What latitude is there for testing the boundaries of those parameters? These are the types of things that people who aren't artists have a hard time grasping before they find themselves tapping away at a keyboard.<br>
    <br>
    That said, if you want to see forced, you should check out much of the fan-drafted SBAHJs. Most of those people seriously have no idea how to dial it back.<br>

    <br>
    Three months is actually not a long time. Think of all the stuff that doesn't manage to get done in three months.<br>
    <br>
    If HS was a thrice-weekly comic, in three months I would have made 36 comics! That's not that many.<br>
    <br>
    Instead I made almost 600 pages and a 3 minute animation. Time was swift but the pace was furious. What's more important, chronology or page count in estimating the dent an arc puts in a story?<br>
    <br>
    I'm beginning to think I don't really have a point to make in answering this question.<br>
    <br>
    To answer the first part: will it be a two year comic? It's already been running for a year and a half, so uh... yeah??? Probably longer, really.

            You know, there has been some buzzin' about it and what not, but I think the truth is it was never actually that controversial.<br>
    <br>
    I've sampled reactions to it all over the place, and it always stuck me as quite a small pocket of the overall audience that ever had any dissatisfaction with it. The same was also true at the beginning of Homestuck. It was a very different thing, and a few people here and there got really restless about it, and swore up and down that MSPA had crested with Problem Sleuth. And of course these sentiments were not in the least bit vindicated in the long run, once we stopped being up so close and personal with the tree of Act 1, and got a little distance from the forest that is HS. I've regarded the vocal minority's present dissatisfaction as the exact same thing. It hasn't deterred me in the least, and even though the recent "AH trolls the fans" thing seems like a strong rebuke of this dissent, it's really very mild one, if one at all. It is meant as playful and humorous.<br>
    <br>
    Now on the FLIPSIDE of this, there is significant group of people that really liked the change in direction this arc presented. In fact, rather than functioning as a drag on the readership's interest, I have observed the opposite. The troll stuff has been like pouring rocket fuel on the fandom. Daily traffic has only gone UP since it started. More people than ever seem to be energetically buzzing about what's going on, debating the merits of the characters and the nature of the alien world, drawing more fan art than I could ever possibly keep track of, creating troll personas and stuff like that. These are not the typical results of making a mistake in a story's direction.<br>
    <br>
    On the subject of, "Was the troll arc, and to some extent the existence of the trolls altogether, really an elaborate set up as a long con to troll the readers?"<br>
    <br>
    Yes and no. There is a little truth to it, in the sense that creating alien kid characters who were both internet trolls, AND literal trolls could very well have been a kind of racial avatarization of my own semi-trolling tendencies as an author, which had been on display well before their appearance. Psyche-outs, cagey self referential stuff and the like, it's all a little spunky, and I remain aware of this, and this stuff does fall into a certain class of trolling. Totally granted.<br>
    <br>
    But all that became much more tangible with the introduction of the trolls. Everything about the trolls was always at least a little antagonizing with varying degrees of playfulness, both to the other characters, and to the reader as well. Their text is a bit difficult to parse (Not impossible! Just enough to make you aware of additional reading effort.) They are all a little ornery, and as it turns out, excessively emotional. Their role in the plot is one of bumbling sabotage and interference with the protagonists. And finally, in maybe the most trollish display yet, their entire introduction through a "detour arc" clearly is a bit agitating to anyone eager to see some of these cliffhangers resolved. It's entirely in the spirit of the indentation they have already made on the story. The reader can either fight it (trolls win!) or roll with it and embrace it on the terms it's presented. (Trolls still win.)<br>
    <br>
    And even within the arc, there are numerous explorations of the trolling theme, like addressing topics that are sure to get people worked up. Examining topics like juggalos, furry fetish porn, shipping, and intricate studies on sci-fi romance, ultimately spiraling into soap opera plot dynamics and character interactions, heavy with conversational drama and teenage histrionics. It's all fuel for getting readers riled up a bit, and if you read it and get this itchy, agitated feeling in the back of your mind, that sensation is called "being trolled".<br>
    <br>
    SORT OF.<br>
    <br>
    None of this should be taken literally as a head-on attempt to troll the reader. It's just not that black and white. The purpose here is still entertainment, and humor, and advancing the plot in ways that have not become clear yet. I think in working on the troll stuff I have learned a little about my own policy toward satire. It's never absolute. Everything I mock is always embraced in some way. The juggalo character, Gamzee, is a good example of this. When he was introduced as a juggalo, people could see the writing on the wall. Here we go, time to do the juggalo shtick and laugh at how ridiculous juggalos are and their weird trashy culture and everything. And we did do that, to an extent! But after the initial !?! moment of revealing a juggalo and getting all hot and bothered about it, that material actually began to be incorporated at face value. It was folded into his character profile, and he turned out to be a pretty lovable guy who likes clowns and a particular beverage, and embraces the memetic affiliation juggalos have with miracles as a form of spirituality. In no way is the character a referendum on how ridiculous and lame juggalos are anymore, or how much we should all think ICP sucks. In fact, in a weird way, he starts to embody a CELEBRATION of those elements. Which to be honest, I think is a pretty good way to handle satire. The same is true, in varying degrees, of the inclusion of fandoms' zeal for shipping (Nepeta), weird horse porn (Equius), LARPing, delving into highly emotional, overwrought romantic intrigue, and so on. All of it is handled in a tongue in cheek manner, as satirical fodder, BUT ALSO played totally straight in some respects, as raw material to define the characters and build the story in a way that takes the elements at face value. With MSPA I am always on the lookout for raw material to manipulate in esoteric ways, and its usually garnered through satire. But then I ride that material pretty hard, and before you even know what's going on, it's not satirical anymore! Ask yourself this: at what point did John's love of Con Air cease to be a mockery of the film, and became more of a SHRINE to it? Hard to say.<br>
    <br>
    That doesn't mean we lose sight of the fact that this stuff is ridiculous. It's still plenty ridiculous. The juggalo movement still strikes me as awfully silly, and so does overzealous shipping. The thing is, we can mock stuff and that's fine. It doesn't mean that stuff demands excessive scorn, or can't be treated as a legitimate topic to roll with in a story. So I think drawing your own horse porn is pretty weird. But who am I to say that's REALLY so terrible? I'm not better than anybody. I'll poke fun at it for a while, but then I'll just roll with horse dicks with a straight face for a while too. Maybe have a beer with them. Turns out they're a good bunch of dicks when you get to know 'em!<br>
    <br>
    And pretty clearly, all of this is followed through with acute self-awareness, which is probably just a kind of handicap I have to live with. I just can't help but be aware of everything I do and all the reasons I'm doing them and apply intense scrutiny to those reasons, and it's very hard for me to feign obliviousness. I guess I'm not that interested in trying. As such, MSPA has always been a pretty meta thing, and from time to time we'll blur into things like troll Andrew. I try to keep it fun. Personally, I find it funny. Spiking Cal is probably one of my favorite pages at this point.<br>
    <br>
    Booyeah.<br>
    <br>
    Oh yeah, also the wolf. I like the wolf page.<br>
    <br>
    Aaaaaaaah.

            Thank you for liking the way I tell stories.<br>

    But I have been telling stories that have been strung together using a great deal of material that is exactly like this.<br>
    <br>
    Didn't you notice??<br>

    Kudos on the wherewithal you showed by failing to be trolled. But that wasn't the sole intent here. It was a form of theater. A farcical pseudo-trolling. The intent was to humorous dividends!<br>
    <br>
    In this regard it was a stunning success.

                Are you a large fan of the "zoom out to put things in perspective" technique? You seem to have used it quite a bit in both PS and HS :D

            There aren't actually that many other methods to use. If the purpose is to show scale, then one way or another, you need to compare the big thing to a smaller thing of known size. You can either do this with zooming, or chop out all the zooming and cut to the chase. But in the case of the sea monster holding the whale, the whale was so comparatively small you couldn't see it, and it no longer conveyed the sense of scale. The zoom was necessary in that case.

    RE: Her last name, Peixes. I don't really know. These things can be open to interpretation. It's Portuguese for fish I think, and has something to do with the Pisces constellation. I think it's pronounced something like PAY-shez in Portuguese, but that's not necessarily the definitive pronunciation key here. It's up to you.

                Andrew, somehow the trolls' adventure, even summarized, is way more interesting than the kids'. Even if you don't agree, if you did, would you consider it a bad thing?

            No, and I don't disagree. But we need to consider some TRU-FACTS;<br>
    <br>
    You could never launch into a story like this cold turkey. You could but it would be really difficult, forcing people to swallow a lot at once. I do think in some way Hivebent stands alone reasonably well, but part of what makes it compelling is the massive pre-education the reader had on the way up to this point. There are so many complex concepts that can now be taken for granted, while we explore a completely different story with new characters, without spending time developing those grounding concepts which is what we were doing for much of the preceding acts.<br>
    <br>
    And yet those concepts are still being elaborated on all the same, through this totally new context. Part of the point of this (the MANY points) is to continue to develop the game they're playing, and demonstrate its incredible flexibility and how many ways it could possibly go. By showing an example of extreme difference, 12 players instead of 4, prototyping a bunch of monsters instead of silly things, how many different fanciful worlds there can be and how the political scene with the kingdoms can play out so differently, we're given a much better sense of this than when we were just told it. Showing this helps the reader continue to extrapolate through imagination the various ways this game could go, and also helps put in perspective how the kids' game is going and how off model they are.<br>
    <br>
    There's a lot of purpose to this arc beyond serving as a cool tangent. Every step of the way we are constantly altering our perspective on what the main protagonists are facing. And when we finally come out of the woods of this thing and get back into the kids' story, our perspective will be completely different from where we left it. And I'm quite sure whatever unique energy is building in the Hivebent story, that will carry over to Homestuck proper when we pick it up again.<br>
    <br>
    But all that said, I think it's cool to be able to tell a story like this in the middle of something fairly unlike it. To essentially inject a humorous scifi world-building tale, follow the complex lives of alien kids on a planet without adult supervision, raised by monsters, all playing a game over the internet. That's a fun premise, and it just wouldn't be the same if not nested inside a bigger story that already did so much of the dirty work. It would be a lot harder to pull off by itself.

            I've heard a few and some are pretty good, but honestly I have trouble listening to even good ones. For some reason none of the pesterlogs feel right to me as real dialogue. This is probably because they were always meant to be true to life chat logs, typed not spoken. If I were writing what was meant to be spoken, I would write quite differently.

    He does appear to have an interest in issues pertaining to troll romance, as clearly does she. Maybe they've had lots of conversations about it in the past and bonded over it in some way?<br>

            How do you know it does? If I'm recalling right, every single gate surrounding it has lead to earth. it's just a matter of when.<br>
    <br>
    Some go in the past to bring important things to earth, to set everything up. Like the kids, the guardians, the ruins, and the game itself.<br>
    <br>
    Most go in the present when the game is being played. Probably to provide the kids with motivation to escape into the game, and get the whole paradox party started.

            I repurpose vast quantities of graphics.<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes it is for speed. And sometimes (as in that case) it was actually slower to do it that way than it would be to just draw it from scratch.<br>
    <br>
    There is an idea which is behind reusing visuals like that, much like I reused the shot of Dave lying on the ground using his iPhone to show a crippled Tavros doing the exact same thing.<br>
    <br>
    The idea is tied to the huge volume of textual callbacks, reusing phrases from the narrative and bits of dialogue, tweaking them sometimes. This happens probably more than anyone realizes. You could possibly read the story ten times and not catch them all. Nothing is safe from reuse. The thing is a litany of a thousand refrains, visual, verbal and conceptual.<br>
    <br>
    So what is the idea? I don't feel like elaborating on it THAT much now, because I would probably type forever. Basically, it's about building an extremely dense interior vocabulary to tell a story with, and continue to build and expand that vocabulary by revisiting its components often, combining them, extending them and so on. A vocabulary can be (and usually is) simple, consisting of single words, but in this case it extends to entire sentences and paragraph structures and visual forms and even entire scenes like the one linked above. Sometimes the purpose for reiteration is clear, and sometimes there really is no purpose other than to hit a familiar note, and for me that's all that needs to happen for it to be worthwhile. Triggering recognition is a powerful tool for a storyteller to use. Recognition is a powerful experience for a reader. It promotes alertness, at the very least. And in a lot of cases here, I think it promotes levity (humor! this is mostly a work of comedy, remember.) Controlling a reader's recognition faculty is one way to manipulate the reader's reactions as desired to advance the creative agenda. In this case I'm not exactly sure what that agenda is all the time, and in truth there probably isn't any serious agenda there. This story, though at times seeming diabolically put together, is still pretty light reading after all. if anything I'm just striving for a certain pitch in density with the all the multithreaded symbolism and endless internal reference. Think of it as a symphony and everything I've referred to as belonging to a vocabulary are really just notes, working together in a really complicated harmonic structure.

                Where'd Sburb come from on Earth? Is it published/distributed by some company? Apparently, knowledge of its existence is more or less public (unlike on Alternia), since it got "reviewed" in GameBro.

            On Alternia, it came from the ruins. The code for the game was contained by the sequence of hieroglyphs on the walls.<br>
    <br>
    It's pretty heavily implied this is also true for the ruins on Earth. It's also pretty heavily implied Jade's grandpa had something to do with the development of the game, since he was the first to explore those ruins.

            John is adorable because he is honest and heroic and nerdy and a good friend.<br>

    I named all the trolls (their trolltags) as a fun exercise some time ago, way before I needed them all. It was like a puzzle. I had the 12 remaining DNA letter combinations, and had to think of a zodiac-pertinent handle for each. Which is easy at first, but gets more challenging when you start winding down to only a few signs and letter pairs left.<br>
    <br>
    Like, ok, I've got CC left and have to think of something reminiscent of pisces. HMMMMM.<br>
    <br>
    It was fun playing with the logic that tied a name to a sign. It would have been dull if everything was a straightup pun. Sometimes the word concealed the sign in it. terminallyCapricious contains capric, i.e. capricorn. gallowsCallibrator contains libra (I also believe this word pair evokes the image of a scale, in a way. A scale of nooses.) Others neither involve wordplay or a hidden word, like adiosToreador. But there is no way you could mistake that for anything but taurus.

    We know there were lots of unique things about their session. Any difference can have an effect on the outcome.<br>

    Perhaps there is one soldier (WV) who always has a rebellious attitude in every session. Perhaps in some sessions this manifests in rebellion. Perhaps in others, nothing comes of it.<br>

    Just like there will always be a Jack with an eye toward mutiny. In some sessions he will succeed. In others he won't. It seems likely he will always try, at least.

                Was there ever a point where you were going to use all the material you had planned for the trolls to make a full on story? Because I get the feeling there's a lot more material then you're going to get through in the time limit you've given yourself.

            No. The objective here is to introduce the characters, and not much else. What happens in their session, the details etc are not as important (to some extent, because we already know the overall outcome). But finding out who they all are is the mission, and doing that requires the substance of a storyline, and a logical sequence of events, whether past, present or future.

                What's the point of being completely underwhelmed with your own story? It stopped being funny awhile ago. For you to be like "Oh, well, look at that" really killed the excitement of the revelation that Aradia is a ghost, at least for me.

            Do you actually think it was a real expression of my personal disinterest in a plot point, or the story as a whole?<br>
    <br>
    I mean was it really SO COMPELLING that it demanded a straight dramatic sale? The last guy to consider the dead all along hook to be really earth shattering stuff was M. Night circa 10 years ago. Yikes, sorry just a dash of genre savvy wiseassery RUUUUUUINED that for you.<br>
    <br>
    Not all of these plot points are especially grandiose in my mind, and are not to be treated with velvet gloves at the expense of losing the light tone that pervades the whole thing. When I feel like a plot development really is major and demands some dramatic clout surrounding it, I treat it more seriously. I think the "Check." moment when the bunny defended John from Jack was a good example of that. There are some others.<br>
    <br>
    But the big ghost-all-along reveal... nahhh. Besides, if you didn't see it coming, it's still plenty exciting if you can somehow manage to summon the fortitude to not let the joke ruin your day.

            I'm suddenly convinced this question was posted to deliberately annoy me.<br>
    <br>
    At this point I pretty much despise the suggestion box.<br>
    <br>
    But this probably has to do with the fact that every time I open it, it breaks the website and I can't even POST the drawings of all the cool suggestions people are in such a frenzy to overwhelm me with.<br>
    <br>
    But aside from that, I think it was a brewing antipathy. Brewing and smoldering.<br>
    <br>
    Here's a riddle: what isn't all that funny or enjoyable?<br>

    Answer: a million ideas at once.

                You're a wonderfully awesome guy, and I respect you infinitely. My question for you: What the hell is with those bizarre adult comic advertisements? As I've read through each mspaint adventure, lurking below each page was a furry, or a nun fondling satan!

            People ask me about ads from time to time, and I should point out that I often go for many days without even looking at my website, aside from the brief glance required to get new pages up. Ads come and go without my awareness, approval, or faintest concern.<br>
    <br>
    I hope I might dispel the notion that I am manicuring a tidy brand here with this website. I mean, maybe I SHOULD be. But I'm not. I'm just making some cool images and a cool story and dropping pages here every day.<br>

            I was thinking about this recently, and I have decided that this sort of complaint is really stupid. Let's break it down and look at the facts.<br>
    <br>
    CG: TYPES IN CAPS.<br>
    <br>
    No problem there. Totally readable.<br>
    <br>
    AT: mOSTLY CAPS, oNLY FIRST LETTER IS LOWER,<br>
    <br>
    Again, perfectly legible.<br>
    <br>
    AA: swaps the letter 'O' with zer0es<br>
    <br>
    If you told me this was hard to read, I'd call you a liar.<br>
    <br>
    AC: :33 &gt; talks like this. uses some cat puns<br>
    AG: Uses the num8er eight instead of B. B's are pretty rare.<br>
    CT: Uses percent sign instead of an X. Also rare.<br>
    GA: Capitalizes First Letter Of Each Word<br>
    <br>
    None of these are the slightest bit challenging to read.<br>
    <br>
    Now the "hard ones".<br>
    <br>
    TA: 2peak2 liike thii2.<br>
    <br>
    Arguably the toughest one to parse. But he doesn't actually have that many conversations in the grand scheme of all this.<br>
    <br>
    GC: SW4PS L3TT3RS "AEI" with "431"<br>
    <br>
    Also somewhat challenging. But we really had a long time to get used to her speech pattern. Plenty of conversations before the troll arc. The letters are caps, matching the size of the numbers for increased readability (deliberate).<br>
    <br>
    Parsing these is just a matter of flipping a switch in your head, on just a few characters, which bear pretty strong resemblance to those they stand for.<br>
    <br>
    Now I understand if this still isn't ideal for perfectly comfortable reading, and I wouldn't want to read a whole book like that for instance, but when you take into account the "hard ones" will occupy probably less than 20% of all dialogue, this whole issue is just dumb.<br>
    <br>
    I can't roll my eyes hard enough at complaints about this.

            I guess I could make a chart. Then again there's all sorts of stuff out there I have nothing to do with, keeping track of it. MSPA wiki, tvtropes articles, material circulating in the forums...<br>
    <br>
    Some people say they wouldn't mind a whole act of troll stuff, or even a whole year.<br>
    <br>
    Then again, some say it's already too much of a diversion from the "real story".<br>
    <br>
    So as usual, tough to please everyone. All I can say is, this arc is serving the exact purpose it needs to serve for the bigger picture, and it'll take exactly as long as it needs to take. If the issue is it's too much of a tangential slowdown from the main story, all I can do is point to the fact that all of Homestuck is constructed almost exclusively of meandering garden paths. Even though these are new characters in a completely different place and time, there's not much new here. This sort of thing has happened before. Introducing WV in act 2 seemed like a massive detour at the time, but later its tremendous relevance was illuminated. In hindsight, I don't think impatience has ever been warranted or vindicated. It all eventually gets tied together, usually pretty maniacally, and sometimes explosively, if given enough time.<br>
    <br>
    Whoops there I go again, talking about stuff that has nothing to do with the question.

            Felt, no. They were just green guys with powers. And I thought of their powers on the fly.<br>

    Trolls...<br>
    <br>
    Coming up with them is the easy part. Introducing them through the "Homestuck fomula", one after another, giving them distinct personalities, roles in the dynamic of the full ensemble, roles in the short story arc to drive the action, distinct voice, chat syntax, appearance, lusus, room, house, weapon, modus, game world, all presented through a fictional alien culture I'm building on the fly simultaneously, and doing it in such a way that's fairly engaging and won't take FOREVER<br>
    <br>
    is challenging.<br>
    <br>
    But I guess that's why I decided to do it.

            Character design is the most whimsical thing for me. For many of them, I don't have a clue what they're going to look like until I'm drawing them.<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes it feels like I'm channeling a design. I'll draw it, then look at it, and say, oh, so that's what that guy looks like. Actually writing the dialogue is a lot like that too.

            I'm still not even really sure how popular it is.<br>
    <br>
    I did always think from the start that the basic gimmick of the format had a lot of viral potential.<br>
    <br>
    But now looking back, I feel like the bulk of the readership has fallen into orbit on account of the preposterous amount of content I've generated in a short timeframe, plus the overall electricity and media volatility of the whole thing in its totality. I picture a great many gawkers gathered around a storm, and most of them can't decide whether what they're looking at is spectacular or horrifying. But they can't look away, and then more gather around to see what everyone's gawking at. And then THEY'RE trapped too.

                when did you realize that you are funny?

        <p>
            This is a really odd question. I'll accept the premise for a moment, and start rambling.<br>
    <br>
    I think I actually remember when I realized I WASN'T funny. It was a really long time ago, maybe when I was in high school. And I drew some dumb bullshit comics of some vaguely humorous nature and assumed they were objectively funny because they were meant to be. They were "funnies". And those are automatically funny.<br>
    <br>
    But then a little later I took a look at those comics. One series was about a singing snail, and I guess there were some others. And I thought, "Holy shit, this isn't funny at all. What was I thinking?" And then later, gradually, I put a more concerted effort into understanding what is funny. I think it was a pretty slow climb. It was also a gradual process of becoming less of a dumbass. Dumbasses think stupid shit is funny, and that can be a major handicap.<br>
    <br>
    The biggest key to being funny is to not be a dumbass. Really stupid people have a hard time being funny (intentionally). The smarter you are, the better the odds you have of being funny. Note that sometimes you run into really smart people who aren't funny, or lack a sense of humor. But note, this is VERY STRONG evidence that they are not nearly as smart as they appear to be! In my view at least.<br>

    When I equate humor as a product of intelligence, I mean it is primarily a product of awareness. The more you are aware of, and the more insight you have into a myriad of things, the more you will be able to successfully illuminate absurdity, and the more clever ways to accomplish this you will be able to conceive of. Awareness lends itself to an agile imagination. This is why stupidity is such comedic poison. Awareness of the world and that from which you draw your satirical muse is deadened by the mind-blunting forces that are associated with stupidity. These forces primarily are a lack of concentration and dedication, and inalertness to all that surrounds you and all content you are exposed to. As well as being quick to judge and label whatever does manage to get through the pinhole. Those are brain killers and comedy killers. They lead to hackneyed work at best, and incredibly awful, prejudicial, bigoted stuff at worst.<br>
    <br>
    Now I don't mean to say I'm a real smart guy and that's why I'm funny, or EVEN VICE VERSA. I'm just pointing out that, in thinking back, becoming less obtuse and deepening my understanding of as much as possible was a turning point in beginning to understand what is and isn't funny.

                On the DoomsDay Scale why didn't she just remove the skull, that would have kept it from hitting the button when the lusus hatched. or build a platform around the button to hold the scale, or the other things she could have done.

    Anyway, what would be the point? Disarming the device in some way wouldn't have helped the egg hatch. From a young troll girl's perspective, it's just some diabolical ancient contraption rigged in the woods, probably meant to stay that way forever. Why mess with it?

                Andrew, I re-watched WV: Ascend, and when the Skyship Base started flying, the map zoomed out to what appeared to be Europe. The base started flying westward towards the Frog Temple. Since the Skyship Base is where Rose's house was, is Rose European?

            Maybe just make a cool flash intro to better suck people in.<br>
    <br>
    And promptly disappoint them in ensuing pages, and somewhat mitigate the impact of such content which arrives later.<br>
    <br>
    So yeah I guess that's a bad idea.<br>
    <br>
    A big part of the experience of reading it I think is this liftoff it achieves with its gradual escalation in every respect, in story and format.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that it's just so "straight" at the beginning, and comparatively bland, is a major part of that stage setting, and something I was very much cognizant of while making it. Much to the lament of those so eagerly anticipating a new story that would instantly echo the magnitude of the final throes of Problem Sleuth.<br>
    <br>
    I can't say a blame anyone who is deflected by the early story for its lack of fireworks. But they are also missing out on an intended effect the work is meant to achieve through its up front banality. This is an unavoidable tradeoff.<br>
    <br>
    I'm not even answering your question anymore, I'm just talking to myself.

            I don't know, honestly a lot of these trolltags were just silly throwaway phrases to match up all the leftover ACGT initials. I never thought I'd introduce most of them. But it's been one of the fun things about it, taking that initial phrase and building something around it to make it logical.<br>
    <br>
    When I originally thought of the phrase "gallowsCalibrator" for instance, I pictured some guy, someone probably much more generically malevolent. Then I'm sure I thought, pffffffff, never gonna introduce THAT guy.<br>
    <br>
    And yet, the greater story purpose for the trolls has always remained the same, and has not yet been revealed. I just thought that purpose would be delivered through a more generic, unseen vehicle of internet trolls bugging kids through messages. But I was wrong.

            Not really. I think the main thing is I would have a real hard time writing a character who I didn't personally like, or at the very least, find interesting. So in order to make it so I don't hate writing someone's lines, I make it so I like them in some way. And in doing so, I guess often other people do as well.

            Getting 12 characters out of the woodwork, even if some are examined a bit more superficially than others, is apparently a pretty serious undertaking. Ideally, each introduction will not be quite as formulaic as the trend presently appears, and this will present opportunity for acceleration.<br>
    <br>
    But I still think it might be another 3 weeks or so with this arc, to put out an estimate with a safe margin. It's just astonishing how quickly time moves versus the rate of artistic production.<br>
    <br>
    EVEN MY RATE.

                Do you feel lately that every musical update from now on has to be part of a significant and vivid animation, and you can't just do short static musical pages like the Harlequin prototyping or Nannaquin anymore?

            I guess if the winding road through Homestuck has yielded anything like a formal policy on Flash stuff, it's that I really don't want to fire up Flash at all unless I'm going to make it COUNT.<br>
    <br>
    I think early in HS I was still figuring out what role Flash would play, and I was still operating under this idea that I would sprinkle in lots of quirky little Flash pages here and there to complement the static stuff, as a compromise to the original idea that every page would be Flash.<br>
    <br>
    Very gradually, this model shifted. It's really nothing like that at all anymore, and the real power of Flash in this format, for this particular story, I think has been revealed to be in adding serious cinematic power to the major moments, and not littering the more run of the mill content with funny little Flash tidbits and short musical interruptions. Not that I think the early content that had that stuff was bad. Not at all. It was all a great part of this thing's evolution.<br>
    <br>
    That stuff doesn't really feel right for where this thing is now though. Like strife pages, mini games, 20 second musical interludes, etc. And effort is a factor here. There comes a time when effort has to be conserved to make sure everything that's happening is contributing constructively to an ultimate conclusion. Doing something like a strife page now would feel like WAY too much of a diversion when looking at the effort required. That wasn't a factor on the slow build up to this though. In fact doing stuff like that was part of the point of the build. To find out what this mixed media story experience could be. So pushing boundaries with Flash for some not especially critical content was perfectly suitable.

            Saying they've hardly even started is just nonsense. They've come a long way.<br>
    <br>
    We can look at his through our obsessive gamer goggles and say "man they've only gone through 1 gate! fuck that!"<br>
    <br>
    Or we can look at it through our storyteller goggles (i.e. my goggles) and realize shit like that doesn't matter. Are we REALLY going to sit there and believe progress will be meted out through the rigorous, literal gaming logic presented? Are we going to go through every gate, watch every subquest, slay every monster and gain every level?<br>
    <br>
    Or is it going to become increasingly less granular, as the trend has shown? Leapfrogging over the unnecessary, the logic and mechanics already wrung of their story mileage through the intensive granularity early in the story? How could I rationally proceed without doing this?<br>
    <br>
    We see evidence of this in the troll arc, as we hop way into the future and back into the past pretty often, making use of all these facts we know, about the game and about the storyline. There's not much to hide or suspend about the way the game works, because we already know. There's not much drama inherent in guarding their future events heavily, because again, we were brought into this with knowledge of where they wind up, and how a generic game session works. The point is to draw out all the characters, show some facets of their story in ways that illuminate aspects of their characters, and ways that help tie their story to the main arc. It all has a purpose, and that purpose can't be fully known until we get there.

    Maybe there's nothing to overcome. Maybe using different media to translate a work will diminish it in some ways, but augment it in others. That would be fine.

            I haven't watched much TV lately. I watched all the Star trek series into the ground, but I was never much of a trekkie. I don't really think Lost was an especially nerdy show. it had a huge audience full of really regular joes who just liked mystery. I liked Arrested Development a lot. Might actually be my fav all time show.<br>
    <br>
    I'm probably not nearly as nerdy as my work makes me seem. I hardly ever play video games or anything like that. Or read nerdy books or play rpgs. My readers could probably nerd me under the table (a table littered with dice and rulebooks!)<br>
    <br>
    I admire them for this.

            In Photoshop you can take any brush and use it in pencil mode, which gives you the hard edges. I used a more transparent brush in pencil mode, and just built up some colors on top of black.<br>
    <br>
    Then I duplicated that layer, amped up the contrast on the copy, and faded in and out over a series of frames.

                You seem to have been drawing a lot more "action panels" in the Troll Arc. Does drawing in that format require a noticeably greater amount of time and effort than drawing in the regular sprite format for you?

            Noooooo. Sprites are quite a pain in the ass to draw. I never feel like an artist when I draw sprites. I feel like a pixel engineer.<br>
    <br>
    Whenever I need to draw something new, and it isn't sprite-based, it's because I'm essentially taking the easy route. Drawing a character with more realistic proportions in cool poses and settings and stuff is relatively effortless compared to sprite work, and doing stuff like zooming 400% so I can fuss over a couple pixels so someone's fingers don't look like total garbage.

                I know you're not answering questions for a while due to chicken sandwich questions, but do you like Nicolas Cage as much as John, or is that just for irony?

        <p>
            Your question can be the chicken sandwich question. "The Chicken Sandwich Question" will be the new name for the last question I answer, and leave at the top for weeks.<br>
    <br>
    I definitely don't like Cage much, nor do I hate him. But I also wouldn't describe my employment of his service as ironic. It's similar to irony, but it's a concept that I truly think eludes verbalization. You would need to sift the mists of my subconscious, and treat the yields to a prolonged, unpleasant examination.<br>
    <br>
    To extract a more practical slice of the issue for the microscope, early in the story I decided I needed something really ludicrous to harp on repeatedly, and ALSO for that thing to prove to be, through a deliberately circuitous path, immensely critical to the plot. This was the bunny. I guess you could say Cage was along for the ride.<br>
    <br>
    If the question is "Why the bunny?" the answer is, because there is nothing you could possibly select to be the critical linchpin of a story that is more stupid than authentic memorabilia from the film Con Air, specifically the stuffed rabbit that Cameron Poe gave to his daughter at the end. You can try to think of something dumber, but you won't succeed.

    They're like these big snorting muscular monsters with these huge faces, and they often freak out, and we RIDE THEM. That's INSANE.<br>
    <br>
    Puppets are funny for some reasons I guess. It's really hard to describe. Like people decided they wanted to make these... smaller fake people? And make them talk and do things. And on their quest they fell ass backwards into the uncanny valley. It's actually kind of a tragedy when you think about it.<br>

            This question is 5 days old. I have not seen another question about it posted more recently!<br>
    <br>
    It's amazing how what seems like a big deal gets forgotten so quickly. People have already more or less forgotten there were ever different songs. In a couple months, the song swaps will be a point of obscure trivia. The whole topic will fade into the lore of the site, known by few and regretted by none (except maybe one person).<br>
    <br>
    I was never under any impression swapping them was the wrong thing to do, or that the new songs were inferior. They were always great, and sorry to say, complaints fell on deaf ears. I'm sort of pathologically unshakable on decisions like that, or really any creative decision.

                Given some of your answers here, would you describe yourself as a bit of a jerk, or is that part of the character we saw behind the fourth wall? And on a related topic, are you answering these questions, or is it said character?

            I guess some of my answers seem testy. Mainly I take opportunities to make humorous remarks, and occasionally, I APPEAR to do so at the expense of another. This is an illusion though. I think everyone's great.<br>
    <br>
    It isn't really a deliberate act, but neither is it how I behave in the real world. I have had a long creative career on the internet. Most of it in the shadows, and much of it established in the tradition of trolling the wide eyed and unsuspecting. The good kind of trolling. The funny kind. Some of that comes through in my current work, and more recently, somewhat literally.<br>
    <br>
    There really is no 4th wall AH character, as is separate from the narrative voice throughout the entire story. That is me, or more specifically, my internet voice. The characters are me too, but I suppose are aspects of my personality that are hyper-accelerated for characterization purposes. If they get a bit sassy at times, and they do, and my narrative voice gets sassy at times, and it does, it shouldn't be a surprise that I do as well.

            No. Some of the trolls share certain personality traits with some of the kids. But there's no formula for it. And it's certainly not as simple as "She's the troll-Jade!" and such. That's not how I view it, or how I planned it.

                For John, entering the first gate meant getting transported to the surface of his "planet" thing, LOWAS. So, Dave is now going to be taken to LOHAC. Rose destroyed her gate, but had she taken it, where would she have gone? She's on the ground already.

    That's like being on top of the Empire State Building, and needing to fly to L.A. So you go downstairs to go to the airport. But the moment you get to the 1st floor, you say, damn we can't go to L.A. now! We're on the ground already!

                Vol. 5 is astounding and joy-inducing. I'd like to know whether the songs were each written to express certain scenes/characters, or if they were meant to more loosely fit the mood/style of Homestuck. If it's the former, what does "Sunsetter" represent?

                Seems like I all do wonder what you planned in advance. From the very beginning, I wondered stuff like 'is John's Dad divorced?' 'are Jade's parents dead?' Then I figured each kid had only one guardian for simplicity. So what inspired the paradox cloning?

            Lots of small subtle things, many of which I can't remember.<br>
    <br>
    Some of these big ideas are like a slow rolling thunder instead of a lightning bolt. In fact, maybe all of them are. It's really hard to pinpoint where exactly major developments originated from.<br>
    <br>
    I think it started from the very simple fact that the two pairs of kids looked similar, and had some profile similarities. And then there was the fact that John's nanna looked to Jade, and her grandpa looked like John. This begged the obvious question, are nanna/granpa actually Jade/John sent back in time??? Which is so obvious, it would be stupid if it panned out like that. So i think creating an explanation for that presented a challenge. An explanation that was somewhat original and completely unexpected, but made sense and used the existing parameters of the story.<br>
    <br>
    There was also a ridiculous drawing I did which was a satirical crack pairing of Rose's mom and Dave's bro, just cause the idea of those two together seemed so absurd. But that actually may have influenced the outcome too.

                Given that Homestuck is building towards some kind of conclusion/confrontation at this point, do you expect it to be anywhere near the level of the DMK fight in Problem Sleuth in terms of length?

            There is absolutely not going to be a long boss battle in HS like there was with DMK.<br>
    <br>
    I kind of regret that that is the inevitable expectation people will have.<br>
    <br>
    With PS, the emphasis was on general gaming satire, and the neverending boss battle was part of that. There was no major plot to satisfy, other than escaping an office, and defeating this monster.<br>
    <br>
    HS has a complicated plot. It is an actual story, and will be wrapped up the way actual stories are meant to be. Will there be service to the gaming parallels present in HS too, as there were with the strife pages? Sure. But an infinite boss fight serves no purpose in this context other than to aggravate an audience. It was ok in Problem Sleuth because there was nothing more to it than that. The battle was a purpose unto itself, strung together with the ridiculous and the surreal and the absurd.

    On a broader note it helps to realize that sometimes people who make stuff that you like will also like things that you don't like and that's ok.

            There was no name preceding the command for EOA3 either: [S] Enter. In that, many entered, generally speaking. In EOA4, many descended, in various ways.<br>

                How many gates did the trolls have? Do they have 7, like the kids, or do they have 23 or some such number? I'm working on an 8 player session with some people and we want to know if we'd have 7 gates, or 15 gates. But it would be nice to know either way.

            If they only had 7 gates, the 12 players couldn't cycle all the way through them. If that was a necessary condition, it would have to be more.<br>

    Other than that point of logic, this doesn't seem like the format for a definitive answer on it.

    One, it's too time consuming.<br>
    <br>
    Two, I think in general it's potentially a bit toxic for authors to be reading RPing of their stuff. It seems like there's always potential, no matter how you steel yourself against the terrible writing, for contamination.

                So is Act Five the final act of Homestuck? I ask because it's rare for something with an act structure to exceed five acts, and things do seem to be speeding towards a conclusion!

                Every-time I go to your website I see the beginning of Homestuck and consider reading again from the beginning. However, the beginning of this story is nothing like the epic proportions we are reading now. Honestly, you didn't know it would be like that?

            I'm not sure I understand. Do you want me to point the homepage to a more recent page? I like keeping it at the beginning for newcomers.<br>
    <br>
    If it's just "did you know how crazy it would get" the answer's yes. That was always the intention. Perhaps not intention so much as grim understanding. I was going off the advancement of PS as a model, and expected to duplicate or surpass that degree of escalation from the very start.

            No. But there were similarities between the two pairs for aesthetic reasons, and some other reasons I guess. Bifurcation in broad personality type. The 4 character designs were drawn before page 1, so things were very loose back then. I left it open, and the cross-similarities between pairs, specifically between Jade and John, led me to get some steam behind the idea that these two very vaguely had "something to do with each other".<br>
    <br>
    What they had to do with each other was something pieced together very organically over the development of the plot. We saw they shared identical towers on the same moon. The logic that they had something to do with each other naturally led to the same principle for Rose and Dave. They got a moon too.<br>
    <br>
    This sort of stuff is all so gradual, and pieced together from so many smaller events, it's hard to pinpoint exactly when an idea originally took shape.<br>
    <br>
    But the idea that they all had that origin was not pulled out of thin air. It was in the works for a good while, and a lot of foundation was laid for it. I would say it had its beginnings when I first introduced the concept of ectobiology, in Rose's next door lab when she made an unsuccessful paradox clone, a two headed cat. The thoughts weren't far off then, like "Maybe this weird way of cloning someone is how the kids were made? Maybe for that matter they created themselves?" Doesn't get more paradoxical than that, and thus wholly in the spirit of the fictional science, and in the spirit of the slowly rolling thunder that is this work's accumulating cache of themes.<br>
    <br>
    But I think was sold it for me was when I got the idea to mix the pairs of slime from their respective guardians. The whole weird mess struck me as an especially novel origin story, and the thought of making these 8 babies all at once was just ridiculous enough to be irresistible. Not just because of the mad science/time travel/paradoxical novelty, but because of the new light it put the characters under. Especially the guardians I think. These weird automaton-like authority figures, mostly obstacles in the early going, are quite probably very much like the kids, just at different stages in their weird lives (i.e. the ones where they lose their facial features). They're all kind of like siblings in a way, even if not all biological. (Though some are!) And I think you could pick up on that from some of the early interactions, that for instance Rose was likely a very similar person to her mom. Her mom just happened to be an adult!<br>
    <br>
    The origin story also lent a lot more relevance to John's designated handle, exctoBiologist. This was never something that was supposed to be significant at all. It was some funny word that tied into his interest of ghosts, and Ghostbusters. (The word was also lifted from an old comic I wrote.)<br>
    <br>
    But now that seems like it was extremely important from the getgo, like it was all FORESHADOWIN' AND SHIT. But of course it's just yet again me connecting another one of these million dots to some others, when the dots were never actually meant to be connected.<br>
    <br>
    I think very few major developments are pulled out of thin air, even if they appear to come from out of nowhere. There is almost always some foundational work for it. These things arrive through the series of details which lead to their cognition in the first place. You can always trace it backwards and find the clues that were pointing to it all along.

    Maybe it just hasn't been at all.<br>
    <br>
    I've thought that the closest thing to being true is that Lost is very much the sort of story I would try to write if left to my own devices, in terms of structure and complexity and involvement of scifi and the supernatural.<br>
    <br>
    Except it would be funny, and not as heavy handed and dour all the time.<br>
    <br>
    As it turns out, I AM left to my own devices! And HS is the result.<br>

            Probably. But any time I come up with backstory stuff and think it won't be necessary, it just finds a way in there anyway.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that nanna and grandpa were raised by Sassacre (before he died) and Betty Crocker was an example of this. It was a funny backstory idea I had quite some time ago, mainly in the form of joking with myself, and said "There's no WAY I'm going to work that in!" And yet here we are.<br>
    <br>
    And somehow when it happens it still manages to feel like it's an important part of the story. At least for me.<br>
    <br>
    One of the things I am most proud about in Homestuck is the fact that I have managed to elevate Betty Crocker to a position of critical relevance to the story.<br>
    <br>
    I think creators probably tend to be proud of really stupid things about their stuff a lot of times.

                Hi Andrew. When making Homestuck, which part of the process takes disproportionate effort and time to produce something rewarding for you? TLDR: which part is most tedious?

            The only thing I would describe as tedious would be setting up a Flash file from scratch, getting the preloader ready to go and everything. I don't mind working long hours on an animation, but I kind of want to get right into it, not spend an hour setting it up.<br>
    <br>
    Rewarding? I don't know. Everything is rewarding.<br>
    <br>
    I enjoy writing the pesterlogs. Probably because it's relaxing. I sit here and go tap tap tap. Instead of ranging around with my stylus like a wild animal, hitting the undo button, and muttering to myself now and then. Writing is easy. Sometimes I think I'd rather just be a writer, and I could say "I'M A WRITER" when people asked me.<br>
    <br>
    BOY would they be impressed!

            There are exactly two words I pulled out of the thesaurus for that. coriaceous and adumbratives.<br>
    <br>
    With the first, I was just wondering if there was a totally ridiculous fancy word for leathery. It turned out there was.<br>
    <br>
    With the second I was looking for an old timey word specifically to nounify for that purpose. The correct form, the adjective, means foreshadowing. In the noun context, I guess it's some vague assortment of wizardly prognostication talismans? I can't claim to be an authority on this.

            The thing is, AND and OR have graceful, easily understood means of being achieved through physical punch cards, by overlapping or double punching. How would these more exotic methods be achieved? You could of course go through the motions of computing them, calculating the new code, typing the code and punching it, but it loses the simplicity of original basic idea that lead to the combinations in the first place. Would going through such machinations just to invoke these more obscure operations actually be interesting? Probably not.

But these were the villains I drafted for that purpose. I later adapted them to the intermission. But had them lying around way in advance, so they made it onto Dave's wall.

            Following up on your webcomic question answered two slots down...<br>
    <br>
    Trying to "get it out there" when your site is only one comic deep shows a misapprehension of the medium you are stepping into.<br>
    <br>
    No one is going to care about a webcomic that consists of only one comic, no matter how good it is. And at this early stage, putting emphasis on the attention your work will receive before any substantial work is done will be a severe creative detriment.<br>
    <br>
    Popularity will always be an inscrutable cross product of novelty, quality, dedication, and luck. Unless you catch crazy lightning in a bottle, it will take at least a year to discover how your formula pans out, probably longer.<br>
    <br>
    Don't even bother looking at your stat tracker. Focus on making something good.

    Also I said it was a terrible idea, but in fact it secretly was a great idea.<br>

    I added the scar to the eye.<br>

    Even then, it wasn't really a true retcon, because I had originally intended to draw the scar but forgot, and didn't get around to fixing it for some time. In fact I actually waited until Jack was eye-gouged in the intermission, specifically to make people go ???????<br>

        <p>
            I don't know about having a magical brain, but I don't keep many notes at all.<br>
    <br>
    I have an HS.txt file, which contains every command in the story so far. That's where I write the commands and below-image text before I post it all.<br>
    <br>
    That file also contains the chum handles of kids and the trolls, their corresponding colors and zodiac signs, the names of all the Felt, a few GPS coordinates, and that's about it.<br>
    <br>
    I never take anything like "plot notes". I just tend to remember all the details. I wrote the whole recap from memory.<br>
    <br>
    I don't even have a very good memory. I forget stuff all the time. But when it comes to story details, I just remember it all for some reason. Which is probably why the thing reads like a chronicle of a million callbacks. Almost every page is calling back something from earlier in the story, whether it's some obscure item or a turn of phrase used by a character or the narrator. Most of this nonsense is just readily available in my rapid recall cache, so it all gets pounded repeatedly.

            It just looked better. If it was smooth, it would just be kind of a boring black circle.<br>

            Who knows?<br>
    <br>
    With the exception of PM and the White Queen, there has been no indication any white agents will be especially consequential.<br>
    <br>
    The white kingdom appears to have a more passive posture, as if playing defense. The black kingdom is on offense, and therefore more aggressive by nature. As such, it's more likely that nefarious key players will emerge on the dark side specifically to cause trouble, like Jack and co. If Prospit were more active in the espionage game (at least in this session) we'd probably have seen corresponding white agents in the spotlight.<br>
    <br>
    But anything can happen.

            Jack is clearly a special case. While the kings and queens abide by certain rules and let the battle play out with certain order and discipline, Jack is more aggressive and ambitious, and more dangerous for that reason.<br>
    <br>
    Which is not to say he's more powerful with a ring than a queen is. A ringed queen could certainly be a very powerful entity, who sits back on the throne for a long time until she's ready to put herself in the action, much like a queen in a real game of chess. What makes Jack more troublesome is his temper, and his will to break the rules.<br>
    <br>
    Part of the purpose of the intermission was to covertly begin characterizing a villain through a back door approach. We learned a lot about his character, even though it wasn't even technically the same character, and never suspected we were getting a primer on the key villain who would rise to power. This was the plan.

    Adding || to the mix was kind of necessary to keep the hole patterns from whittling down to nothing, as would be the case if you just kept &amp;&amp;-ing everything.<br>
    <br>
    Not that most people care about this, or even understand it really.<br>
    <br>
    Computer people frequently harp on the fact that it should be the bitwise '&amp;' and '|' operators rather than the boolean '&amp;&amp;' and '||'.<br>
    <br>
    Which I guess is technically true. But the first and most important point is I didn't like how they looked as single characters. Especially '|' looked stupid to me. The double chars are more expressive, and perfectly understandable if you're a coder, and meaningless if not.<br>
    <br>
    But aside from that, what's to say &amp;&amp;/|| wouldn't have that meaning in this application context? It's completely up to the author of a language to draft the meaning of operators. Various chars can have many different meanings across different languages. They often do.<br>
    <br>
    Card A &amp;&amp; Card B in this universe simply means, for each bit, evaluate Bit A &amp;&amp; Bit B.

            Here is something I wrote about 5 years ago, back when the whole topic was more novel to discuss.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    How to be Funny on the Internet: Lesson 1<br>
    <br>
    The Internet is nothing if not a boundless population of aspiring comedians. They utilize this uncensored medium as an incubator of sorts for their abilities as humorists before exploding onto the standup circuit. While this will is universal, being a natural humorist is far from it. Luckily, I have a roadmap that will guide you towards the appearance of being funny on the Internet, if strictly adhered to.<br>
    <br>
    Mention Ninjas.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;A blur of black in a dim room. As the emperor ponders his koans, he cracks an eyelid. But it&rsquo;s too late. Who else could make off with ancient scrolls and the lion&rsquo;s share of a kind emperor&rsquo;s spine before the shutter has yet swung closed from entry? If your answer was &lsquo;not a ninja&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re fucking retarded.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Ninjas are evidently hilarious. Particularly if alluded to in a manner that might be construed as tongue-in-cheek. But not completely. You don&rsquo;t want to come off like you&rsquo;re making fun of ninjas, because it is common knowledge that they are awesome.<br>
    <br>
    If you are unlearned in the vicissitudes of cyberspace, you may find this confusing. I will try to explain. The first thing to realize: ninjas are awesome. There is nothing not awesome about them. They are practically the archetypical embodiment of awesomeness. So what exactly is so funny about them? Actually (and this is what may be hard to understand), nothing at all. When a ninja is invoked in any context, the response promotes the illusion that something humorous was said. But what has actually occurred is a mutual celebration of ninjas&rsquo; all-around awesomeness, kind of like an &ldquo;implied high five&rdquo;.<br>
    <br>
    But wait, there&rsquo;s more. You don&rsquo;t want to get too wrapped up in how awesome ninjas are. That would be comedic seppuku. This will breed an attitude of reverence, and you begin to take them too seriously. Taking things seriously is nerdish, and very unfunny, especially on the Internet. You will become the target of ridicule, rather than targeter. This is why you must take a step back, and strike that intuitive balance between reverence for, and an outright mockery of ninjas. The joke becomes the fact that they are awesome, and they become MORE awesome because they are the joke. Place them in curious juxtapositions, mix them with references to pop culture. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it.<br>
    <br>
    And one final thought. Once you have digested all of this, and then mastered it, realize this profound scrap: the joke is actually the joke. Meditate on THAT.<br>
    <br>
    Mention Pirates:<br>
    <br>
    Pirates are also hilarious, and mentioning them will make you hilarious as well. This is for a similar set of reasons that make ninjas are funny. They are awesome. But awesome for different reasons. True, both classes share themes of danger, deadliness, and being generally badass. But while ninjas convey stealth, precision, and cunning, pirates evoke a sense of adventure, bravado, and foolhardy swagger. Their passion for buried riches is legendary, and they are not too proud to sing and dance either, provided a steady flow of rum. Mentioning pirates will conjure visions of all these things, and your friends will be enamored of your ruggedly adventurous sensibilities.<br>
    <br>
    But as is the case with ninjas, your deployment of pirate references must also be tongue-in-cheek. You don&rsquo;t want to come off as actually being into pirates seriously. That would be idiotic. Again, it&rsquo;s like a verbal high five in celebration of pirates and what they represent. Consider a literal high five for a moment, between a couple of guys. It&rsquo;s not about the momentary slapping of skin. It&rsquo;s a symbolic gesture celebrating good times. If it were actually about the touching, the feeling of the other male&rsquo;s skin on yours, and that&rsquo;s what you liked about the high five, your mate would quickly become uncomfortable as you prolonged the gesture, caressing his palm. He would think you were gay. This brings us to the next point&hellip;<br>
    <br>
    Call Things &ldquo;Gay&rdquo;.<br>
    <br>
    Being associated with homosexuality on the Internet, particularly being called &ldquo;gay&rdquo;, is to be avoided. On the other hand, calling people and things &ldquo;gay&rdquo; yourself is a good way to help you in your quest to be funny. It lets people know the following:<br>
    <br>
    1) You aren&rsquo;t too politically correct to humorously equate homosexuality with something negative. This is not to say you dislike gays or the practice of being gay. You just know how to stay loose and have fun, you know?<br>
    <br>
    2) You clearly have opinions on things, particularly dislikes. Hating things, or more importantly, appearing to hate things, is a really excellent way to create the illusion that you have interesting thoughts, and a complex set of criteria for evaluating things for quality. This will intrigue people, who may secretly fear that your outlook on which things are gay might be more sophisticated than their own. Who knows, you may get some converts to your (largely fictional) set of values.<br>
    <br>
    Call Things &ldquo;Retarded&rdquo;.<br>
    <br>
    If you don&rsquo;t see why this word by itself is milk nostril-evacuatingly side-splitting, you&rsquo;re fucking retarded.<br>
    <br>
    Conversation Exercises:<br>
    <br>
    Actor A: &ldquo;Hey man, that website you showed me the other day was so gay.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Actor B: &ldquo;You must be retarded. You&rsquo;re so retarded, your grandmother was raped by fucking pirates.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Actor A: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say shit about my grandmother. She WAS a pirate. Trained by secret ninjas to do some totally un-gay moves on retarded gay people like you.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Actor B: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d appreciate you not bringing my sexual orientation into this.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Actor A: &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Actor B: &ldquo;You know, I think you&rsquo;re right. That website is pretty gay.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Lesson Summary:<br>
    <br>
    The themes in this lesson you have noticed, and indeed the key most Internet-driven humor, are:<br>
    - Mentioning things. By mentioning funny things, you seem funny.<br>
    - Use 2 hilarious words a lot.<br>
    - Communicate poorly developed opinions with those words.<br>
    <br>
    With a little practice, these rudimentary skills will be yours. Try using Google to dig up a picture of a ninja for your e-journal. Use the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; to describe the next movie you see, even if you like it. Oh man, I&rsquo;m laughing already!

            probably can town, but not even because of the town itself. it lead to WV identifying himself as a mayor, which lead to the civic role themes for other exiles, and the fact that those themes carried over to their former roles in the kingdoms, which became the vehicles for certain plot objectives.<br>

    the references to gushers were also completely command influenced.

            short term planning of things like that happens, and it seems really whimsical at the time of the idea, but then execution of the ideas gets delaaaaayed, and then suddenly the plans seem not so short term anymore. (from my perspective. from your perspective, these things still seem like bombshells i guess.)<br>
    <br>
    both of those concepts mentioned were thus planned as such more than a month in advance i think, and i just hung on to the ideas until they were ready to spring.<br>
    <br>
    but then there are little adjustments that happen in the execution which i don't plan, and just pull out spontaneously. often this involves scaling back an idea because it's a bit too complicated to depict in the hot frenzy of grinding out a flash animation. a lot of times i think i have more time in an animation to squeeze more events in, but in reality, it's really easy to chew up the minutes of a song with a few simple cinematic events, and you turn around and you're out of time.<br>
    <br>
    that phenomenon leads to a lot of the density present in the animations. segments where seconds are going by and things are flying by so fast you barely notice all the detail coming together to tell the story, so you have to replay it a few times to get it.<br>
    <br>
    but that's fine, it's part of the format being forged here. in a video game cut scene, you don't really always have the luxury or inclination to go back and replay it. here you do, and replays are actually a fairly critical part of digesting everything.

            i think pride stopped being an active concept for me once i got in a groove. hence i was probably most proud of the first strife john had with his dad, which at the time seemed pretty radical. it now feels pretty old hat and each one i do is just another plank slotted into this story's platform. a sense of pride and accomplishment will come again when i can roll a ball bearing across that completed platform without any bounces or skips.

            i don't know, but it's pretty mysterious. it happens all the time. the most important lesson i have taken from working on mspa is that i am sort of magic, like this weird little man from a very obscure pocket of irish mythology called a "leprechaun".<br>

            GC's... no longer than anyone else's. except for the extra "syntax burden", which is pretty minor.<br>
    <br>
    most of the character writing is fairly stream of consciousness for me. i write pretty fast and don't edit much.<br>
    <br>
    the ones that are most time consuming are when i have to think of complex mechanics beyond mere funny conversation. like when trolls are talking to the kids from different points in the timeline, influencing past/future conversations in various ways.

            nope, not any whatsoever. honestly i was always quite put off by the idea of getting into animation.<br>

    unfortunately i was dragged kicking and screaming into the discipline by the allure of creating something really really cool.<br>

            this might sound lame, but i had the idea for the self-insert a long time ago, and decided then if i did it, i'd make myself wear the sepulchritude shirt. i think i decided that when that shirt was newer and more of a novelty.<br>
    <br>
    BUT.<br>
    <br>
    it actually sort of makes sense, since the 4th wall thing came on the heels of jack noir's rise to power, which visually is quite reminiscent of a reverse-sepulchritude transformation. or an evil sepulchritude.<br>
    <br>
    the shirt even has black wings (inky wings per the inky theme of the attack) which is actually even more in keeping with noir's transform than PS's. so it's not like it has no symbol-relevance.<br>
    <br>
    as an artist/storysmith i tend to think about stuff like that as much as i can. which is another way of saying i'm good at rationalizing random decisions i make.

                Were the trolls an element you had planned out from the beginning, or did you only come up with them later on in the story? They seem so integral at this point, despite their late introduction.

        <div class="cright"></div>

    <div class="response-container">
        <p>
            they were absolutely not even remotely planned from the beginning or anywhere close for that matter.<br>
    <br>
    wait let me copy something i wrote from somewhere else that might be informative.<br>
    <br>
    it's about the DNA letters, the pesterchum name abbreviations, and how that led to the trolls.<br>
    <br>
    The DNA connection began well before I ever even thought of the trolls.<br>
    <br>
    I named EB, TT, TG, in that order. I noticed an unfolding pattern with the latter two, and then named GG to solidify this pattern.<br>
    <br>
    I assumed EB was just a special case for whatever reason, much like he is in other ways. For instance, the other three all have close birthdays in December, while his is in April. I figured very early on that he would have an alt account to complete the pattern, but hadn't developed the plot device to explain the alt until the trolls surfaced.<br>
    <br>
    The DNA connection with GT, TT, TG, GG I also noticed early on, and in fact largely precipitated the existence of the trolls, and was the sole reason for there being 12 of them. (12 remaining DNA letter combos, and some people theorized there would be 12 based on this before it was clear how many there were.) Additionally, the fact that there were 12 was what prompted the zodiac connection.<br>
    <br>
    It may also be interesting to note that for GT, TG, TT, and GG, the like-letters are girls, and differing letters are boys, which correspond to chromosomes XY (male), and XX (female). Trolls do not follow this pattern because, first, there are only AA and CC left which would mean only 2 girls in the group ( :C ) and second, they aren't human, so their chromosomes probably work differently. For now, all we know is the girls begin with G, but the logic probably needs to be more elaborate than this if there are any more girls in the group.<br>
    <br>
    There is further rationale for John's defection from the pattern, from GT to EB, which possibly will never be explained in the story. What caused him to defect was the trolls, a group ostensibly lead by CG, whose name obviously implies cancerous disruption within a genetic system, or a DNA code. His cancerous influence causes a defect in the full string of genetic characters, from GT TT TG GG | CG GC GA AG AC CA TA AT TC CT AA CC to EB TT TG GG | CG GC GA AG AC CA TA AT TC CT AA CC. This is the nature of cancer, to corrupt genetic data. There may be additional relevance to the fact that John defected to ectoBiologist, the name of a pseudo-science sounding similar to carcinoGeneticist. In fact, I believe this will prove to be relevant later on.

            sometimes, but i don't think i ever stop drawing. just now and then while i'm drawing i probably form an expression of befuddlement or disgust at my present behavior.<br>
    <br>
    one example i guess was when i was making the dutton panel:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003278" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003278</a><br>
    <br>
    and i had to make a "doodle" that looked like a whimsical random sketch, but the tablet interpreted as a dutton head. so i think i wound up drawing about 30 or 40 quick random sketches on top of dutton's face before i got one that looked right, and i'm sure at some point in the process i stopped to think what an odd practice this was for a person to be engaged in out of context. (or even in context)

                I think the major downside to those interactive pages is the anxiety that we won't make the right choice and thus won't be able to experience the best thing possible. It's the idea that we'll miss something important.

            here's something else to note about it:<br>
    <br>
    even though the interactive pages seem like a RADICAL DEVIATION in common storytelling practices, they're really not.<br>
    <br>
    many of us have played hundreds of hours of RPGs like final fantasy doing the same thing, running around, talking to everybody in a town, making sure you don't miss anything.<br>
    <br>
    i guess it's less unnerving in an RPG because that's A) what you're expecting to do, and B) what you're doing CONSTANTLY through the whole game, with little pockets of story progression interrupting now and then.<br>
    <br>
    so keeping a reader/player comfortable is mostly about conforming to their expectations, and staying within the established parameters of the medium.<br>
    <br>
    i guess i'm not that concerned with reader comfort! this isn't a luxury automobile. it's more like a rickety jeep, serviceable on an outrageous safari.

                The Act 4 opening, while epic in its own way, was much less interesting than a simple flash animation or multiple ones would be. I don't think it was worth the effort you and your team put in. I love it, but you could've saved time and made it better.

            on some level i agree, but to scrap initiatives like that entirely goes against the grain of the experimental nature of this thing. (also in this case my "team" is really just me and gankro. there wasn't THAT much more effort involved than usual, save his coding efforts done mostly in tandem with the art.)<br>
    <br>
    dramatically speaking, it would have been more powerful to arrange a hard wired animation set to cool music, and dictate exactly what the reader is supposed to see and learn about the story. but the downsides are you sacrifice the curveball element, and fail to push the envelope on the medium. i prefer keeping these upsides, even if just in small doses.<br>
    <br>
    i found it kind of interesting to see the variety of reactions to that page, specifically that there appears to be a class of people who are grumpy about the concept, when faced with having to do something themselves to drive the story. which is a somewhat understandable reaction. if you go to a movie and all you want to do is tune out to what's on the screen and let the director do all the driving, you'd probably be perplexed or irritated if a controller popped out of the seat in front of you half way through and you had to control the characters for a while. but that's not quite what you're signing up for here. anything goes, and the only reason i don't do stuff like that more often is due to the labor involved.<br>
    <br>
    but when i see that sort of reaction to it, it makes me think i should be doing it more. people get comfortable with the status quo very easily, even when that status quo itself isn't all that old (i've only been including these heavy duty flash animations in mspa for less than a year). meandering outside this comfort zone gets people agitated, and the more people get agitated the more i'm tempted to think i'm on the right track, or at least further exploration is warranted. sometimes a good idea has to be really rammed down people's throats for them to understand it's a good idea, because you'll always have to surmount their curmudgeonly resistance to innovation, and as always, the preposterous love affair the masses seem to have with mediocrity.

            i doubt the story will ever address the details of their bonding process. if anything, it may touch on how they all met in the first place (and has already sort of, with john's time traveling package to jade)<br>
    <br>
    most of the story so far has been a window into a group of friends whose relationships have already been well established for years and already have strong bonds of friendship. many things they say and allude to points to this strong preexisting bond.<br>
    <br>
    part of introducing the trolls to the story has been taking on a new challenge, which is to document the process of the group of four kids making new friends (albeit in a pretty unusual fashion). we know the personalities of the four kids very well by this point, so now we're getting to see how those personalities mesh with new people outside their social bubble, and how in their own ways they're sort of reversing the antagonism of these self appointed adversaries and turning them into friends, even in spite of everyone's best efforts to avoid that outcome.<br>
    <br>
    as always, friendship prevails.

                So where did you get all these musicians from? Did you just ask some guys to do some? Did some guys just come to you? I'm just curious, since this web... adventure... comic... game... whatever has basically one of the greatest soundtracks. It's amazing.

            at the beginning of HS i put the word out i was looking for musicians, and about 40 or so got back to me over a day or two.<br>
    <br>
    many of them kind of drifted away from the project or never made much in the first place, leaving behind a smaller core of very enthusiastic and talented participants, which is responsible for most of the music in HS so far. i added a few more people to the pool recently, since over time some more great musicians (mostly from the community) were clearly excited to make music and participate, so i said sure why not.<br>
    <br>
    i wish i could use all the great stuff they make. but that's why i want to put out more albums, to get more of their work out in the open.

            wrong!<br>
    <br>
    i wrote something "SERIOUS" about sbahj recently. here it is, pasted from elsewhere.<br>
    <br>
    It's clearly rooted primarily in jackassery which no doubt is not for everyone but it's presence in the story does have an ACTUAL LITERARY PURPOSE.<br>
    <br>
    It is an invention within the universe for the kids to reference amongst themselves endlessly. Friends on the internet do this all the time. Instead of using memes from reality, I made this one up as a satirical project of one of the characters. The strip provides the core of memes that fuels much of their banter, and that core is added to as I (Dave) make(s) more comics. Certain memes upon reaching a critical density begin to accumulate an entire vocabulary to slip into during casual banter amongst those familiar with it. That is what has happened, and the density is such that the vocabulary has even permeated the narrative itself.<br>
    <br>
    Those who don't care for SBaHJ much or merely "put up" with its presence in HS most likely are not appreciating the fact that it is mostly another device employed for rigorous universe building. In no way is its attachment to HS just a vehicle for hocking it as one of my asinine side projects. If it strikes many as a viable standalone form of entertainment it is only because it has that effectively served my purpose for it, which is to build this universe.

            i've always tended to go to sleep late, but HS has pretty much nullified any sort of predictable sleep pattern i used to have.<br>
    <br>
    most nights i go to sleep between 4-6 AM. a lot of the flash updates have kept me up to even sillier hours, like 8, 9, 10 AM. and a fair number of times i just never bothered going to sleep at all.

                I feel the pace of HS has improved over that of PS; how do you manage the pacing of an organic story? What have you learned about fluid storytelling that might have helped keep a shmuck like me interested in updates instead of alienated by too much?

            i have no idea why you like this thing!<br>
    <br>
    i always tend to assume at least 99 out of 100 people will want nothing whatsoever to do with HS, whether due to its complexity, or its peculiar format.<br>
    <br>
    and i keep being surprised that so many people keep tuning in. then again, i'm also surprised by how popular Lost is, when you might expect a show of such complexity would scare people off.<br>
    <br>
    maybe what i'm discovering is people actually like complexity, and will even gravitate toward it, as long as it isn't a total train wreck. if you unapologetically tackle high complexity head on, and pull it off somewhat, it seems like people respond well to it. sure they may not understand it. (and if you've ever heard people speculate about Lost, they definitely don't) but they like it.<br>
    <br>
    as for fluidity, i really don't know. that's not a property i'm cognizant of while working. i just try to make sure every page has some purpose, whether it's just funny or amusing, or advances the story in some way. the most important page is always the one i'm working on. i never put out pages just to take up space or kill time. i think if a story manages to be a succession of meaningful, entertaining events, then that fluidity happens automatically.

                I'm always really impressed with the spirograph design for the Gates. what sort of gumption went into its conception and creation? in its Flash appearances, is it really just composed of lots of little curved lines moving into different positions?

            the spirograph in flash is a single curved line.<br>
    <br>
    multiplied by 10, each rotated radially around the center.<br>
    <br>
    then those 10 are copied, pasted, and flipped horizontally.<br>
    <br>
    when i animate it, i only animate one line.

                Why have you moved away from letting the fans control the story? You seem more and more to have a plot you want to use and pretend to you submissions by fans that actually would have fit into the story already in your head. Give MSPA back to the fans!!

            to tell you the truth it's statements like this that just make me want to stop using reader commands forever.<br>
    <br>
    there are many types of objections like this pertaining to the format that get dredged up which are based on a complete misunderstanding about how user input works.<br>
    <br>
    first point: when there are hundreds of commands, you have nearly every absurd idea imaginable to choose from. so what criteria should i use to select? how about ones that sync up better with ideas i've had, and help move the story? you suggest i do just the opposite. so i should ACTIVELY SUFFOCATE my own ideas in favor of RANDOM DUDE X's ideas, even though there are hundreds of RANDOM DUDE X's all making noise at once, and there is no particularly strong case to be made for any above the others? following your advice not only makes no sense from a creator's perspective, it would actually sabotage the story in the long run.<br>
    <br>
    second point: reader commands are great for the story's early climb, establishing some elements, making something out of nothing, etc. they are not good for wrapping things up. in the early going, there is a huge amount of granularity to the action. pick this object up. put it over there. walk through that door. and so on. you just can't finish a story with these micro actions though. at some point you have to start speeding up, and tying loose ends. reader commands don't do that though. they will always speak in the language of micro actions, because that is pretty much the only thing a mock-player can do.<br>
    <br>
    these are the remarks of someone who has spent HUNDREDS of hours thinking about these issues and trying to make it all work. people who say stuff like "give it back to the fans!" obviously haven't even spent a minute thinking about it. The fans were only ever in control in a limited way, and everything takes shape at my discretion. people just get really carried away with the whole "reader driven" idea and form these weird fantasies about how it works, and then take umbrage when my decisions are in violation of this fantasy protocol!<br>
    <br>
    really the only thing i don't like about the format is it seems to lend itself to these misunderstandings.

                When you were writing Problem Sleuth, how much research did you have to do / did you (not) do, or did you already learn everything from prior education?

            "writing" sure is a weird verb to apply to problem sleuth. but ok we'll run with it.<br>
    <br>
    generally i don't reach much further than the boundaries of my existing knowledge base for ideas. just because it's much faster that way. and if i'm doing "research" to get ideas, what would i even read? maybe pay a visit to the idea wing of the library?<br>
    <br>
    homestuck has actually involved a fair amount of research, but usually a very specific and targeted kind. sometimes i can't believe the sort of things i find myself looking up for story purposes.<br>
    <br>
    one example was when i was making the [S] Ascend page and started poring over GPS coordinates of real places in the world. like scouting out locations in the adirondacks park in new york for various waterfalls for a plausible location of rose's house. i settled on a pretty big waterfall called "rainbow falls" and found the exact gps coordinates for that and plugged it into WV's station terminal when he was taking off. the name of the falls became sort of relevant later, because when rose entered the medium her house then straddled a literal rainbow waterfall. i also looked for plausible coordinates for jade's island, and found this weird patch in the pacific ocean that looked like it had been edited out by the government or something. maybe it was! or maybe it was just a shallow, boxy look reef. didn't really matter, i was just looking for something mysterious. john has a real world location too. in fact, his real life address is a house that's for sale. he lives by a lake in washington called pipe lake, which his father probably chose for obvious reasons.

    yes i use a tablet, and the line size changing you refer to is probably on account of its pressure sensitivity feature. also yeah i do it on purpose, but also yeah i am kind of magic too.

            at first it was all jan doing the hands-on editing while i sort of "directed". then later as we built up more steam i did some hands-on editing too, and we sort of each did our own thing, mixing and matching clips and ideas.<br>
    <br>
    but then i found less and less time to work on it as i spent more and more time doing mspa stuff. i estimate i've done twice as much drawing for HS so far as i did for all of PS, if not more (i did a lot of editing at the same time as working on PS) it's fair to say that HS killed the editing projects.<br>
    <br>
    well, that and i had some computer issues that made it tough to get editing done. also jan had to look for jobs and stuff. boring life shit getting in the way of cool things a lot of internet nerds feel entitled to having fed to them for free forever, as usual.<br>
    <br>
    but we'll do some more later for sure, when we free up the time.

            there's nothing all that special to it.<br>
    <br>
    personally i find it hard to believe that anyone who struggles to update their comic/whatever in a steady fashion actually cares about it all that much.<br>
    <br>
    enjoyment of the process is the first and most important thing.<br>
    <br>
    and then there are the details, knowing your limits, exactly what you want to accomplish, etc. i'm focused on creating the maximum impact with the most efficient expenditure of energy. max impact in this case means most story output conveyed as effectively as possible. that formula has gotten pretty streamlined with mspa.<br>
    <br>
    then, once you've nailed the formula down: WORK ON IT AS HARD AS YOU CAN

            no, the trolls we nowhere close to being on the horizon when i started. like many many other things.<br>
    <br>
    and i haven't designed any of them other than those already seen in the story. most things, almost everything in fact, are not designed until the very moment i need to draw them. the four main characters are one of the few exceptions to this.

            i don't know, it's one of those ideas that was fun to execute and would be fun to revisit, but then there are JUST SO MANY things like that. i think sometimes in a story that exhibits the sort of density that HS has, it's got to be good enough just to put a funny idea out there, play with it a while, and then let go of it forever.

            i would guess it's sort of obvious to anyone really immersed in this stuff that it would be dave. but that's not a coincidence, because his style most closely approximates my own internet chatting style. he's pretty much an exaggerated trollish wise ass version of my own previous web persona iterations. i draw from this reservoir of experience in crafting his profile.<br>
    <br>
    a handful of his conversations are lifted almost word for word from some of my own old chatlogs, with some minor context adaptations. very minor, because actually the subjects of those conversations helped me craft the content of the story.

            i don't know. the only thing i'm really caught off guard by is how much longer it's taken to make progress in HS than i thought it would. (flash gets the blame)<br>
    <br>
    the main reason i've included MC in HS so heavily is because i came SO CLOSE to just giving up on the HS idea at the beginning and running with a much easier to implement non-flash MC adventure. but then i made some modifications to my approach, decided to use flash stuff more rarely, and stuck with HS.<br>
    <br>
    so in an alternate universe right now, i'm doing an MC adventure, not HS. which is literally what's going on in HS when they tune into MSPA.

            it's sort of sad to think about, but i don't believe i've improved my drawing skill one iota since starting mspa. animation skill, yes. (as in, from zero to something)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    i've always purposefully drawn well beneath my actual skill level for the sake of speed, and occasionally digging a little deeper whenever i feel like it. to really IMPROVE, i would need to be pushing the envelope artistically much more than i have been.<br>
    <br>
    the only reason it looks like i've gotten better between jailbreak and now is because i switched gears from "i don't give a shit" to "i sort of suddenly give a shit"

            he's a compelling muse. i'm moved by his commitment to a single small sample of dinosaur clip art. also his passion for taking humorous ideas and conveying them through funny remarks. he's sort of like a word clown. the only of his kind.

                I was just wondering cause you seen to be really good at writing in voice, have you had any formal writing experience (school, job, or whatever), or did you get this good by yourself and just writing a lot?

        <p>
            well as is the case with a lot of these questions i guess ill first say thanks thanks and more thanks.<br>
    <br>
    i dont have formal writing experience or training. not creative writing anyway. plenty of technical writing experience though. my trainin's in 'puters.<br>
    <br>
    ive never thought of myself as a writer at all. more of a storyteller, during loftier musings, and a joke teller all other times. writing is one tool i use to tell stories at the moment. its a craft ive improved, semi-deliberately, only for the sake of improving the storytelling process.<br>
    <br>
    in typing out that reason it sounds weird. is there any other reason to do so? when i listen to aspiring writers talk about stuff i often get the sense theyre in it for more than that. like theyre trying to heal some hole in their aura which is preventing them from truly BEING A WRITER. i dont know.<br>
    <br>
    i think writing in voice is pretty simple. its mostly about consistency. choosing a set of parameters and committing to them absolutely. it can even be a shitty set of parameters and a crappy character. but if you keep hammering away at that voice, people will say, damn thats some pretty good characterization there! i mean... they might be WRONG. but theyll SAY it.<br>
    <br>
    the advantage in being so obstinate with the profile you choose is then any deviation you make will be very noticeable. this is to your advantage, if you can control these deviations with purpose and precision. such deviations can serve as the pillars for character development. they cant happen without the consistency first. and ironically, without the consistency, they DO happen. for the wrong reasons. because you fucked up.<br>
    <br>
    syntax is not a typical part of voice in most works but its one ive latched onto aggressively in HS and perhaps solidifies the illusion of strong voice. in fact ive become so conscious of syntax-voice, i noticed for some reason when answering these questions ive gravitated towards an ad hoc syntax, no caps, no apostrophes, otherwise punctuated. i am fearful of deviating from it. because it will mess with your heads if i do. and mine.<br>
    <br>
    See, look. Instant syntax upgrade. It's hard to believe this is even the same person talking!<br>
    <br>
    Inconsistency can be one of great calling cards of utter trash. Glorious inconsistency, artful inconsistency even, I think is something to behold. It's like a window into a defective mind. These are principles I employ in SBaHJ. They interest me for some reason. Will this sentence end with a period? No, looks like it won't. But this one will. Why was that particular word misspelled? Why not just misspell every word? That would make no statement. It would invite no speculation into a uniquely defective thought process.

    i dont usually make a lot of typos in general, but with mspa i am a typo machine for some reason. maybe because in most cases the text is sort of an afterthought.<br>

    i had this idea a while ago that i would make polls to determine prototyping. such as:<br>

    - wizard statue<br>
    - princess doll<br>
    - maplehoof<br>
    <br>
    or such<br>

    and then run with the results. but that somehow seemed like too much trouble.<br>
    <br>
    it wouldnt have been too much trouble if not for that fact that i was up to my neck in animation chores. the inclusion of flash pages, while it may seem like i slip them in there gracefully, is sort of an albatross around my neck in some regards. the effort involved tends to crowd out all sorts of cool ideas i would be implementing otherwise. promoting additional democratic storybuilding mechanisms is just one example of such a casualty.

    Liquid Negrocity too from the MC album.<br>
